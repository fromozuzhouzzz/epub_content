  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll Chinese are historians. Of course, I am exaggerating. I say this to explain that people in China love to use historical figures or episodes to understand, comment, insinuate, or subtly criticize politics today. History shapes the world view of most Chinese in an extremely impor­tant way.</p>

  <p class="text">In this chapter, I first explain that Chinese leaders draw inspiration from history when making critical decisions. Moreover, Chinese leaders are disciplined by their expectations of how they will be judged by history. I also explain that most people in mainland China perceive the country’s modern history as starting with the Opium War (1840–1842), which was the start of the “century of humiliation.” As a direct implication, the common view in mainland China is that Hong Kong and Taiwan have to be properly united with China in order to end the humiliation. Most impor­tant, perhaps, is that most Chinese, based on history, do not expect a rising China to replace the United States as the world’s hegemon, but they do believe that US-­led preemptive attacks on China must be resolutely fended off.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Mao Zedong was extremely </span>well-­versed in Chinese history. Until his death, he kept stacks of history books alongside his huge wooden bed. He drew inspirations from history for his most <span aria-label="23" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23" role="doc-pagebreak"/>critical decisions. One famous example is how the history behind the Peking Opera play <span class="italic">A Farewell to My Concubine</span> inspired Mao to keep fighting in the Chinese Civil War.</p>

  <p class="text">In 1949, the Communist Party had occupied northern China despite the overwhelming strength of the Nationalist Party forces, which had been given US military equipment. The Communist Party was at a crossroads, considering whether China should follow the Korean and the German model: divide the country into two parts, with the north controlled by the Communist Party and the south controlled by the Nationalists.</p>

  <p class="text">Chairman Mao was inspired by the famous story about War Lord Xiang Yu, who 2,200 years ago was the most powerful leader to rebel against the son of the first emperor, Qin Shihuang. Xiang Yu controlled almost the entire country when his most fierce competitor, Liu Bang, acknowledged his power and asked whether they could coexist peacefully. All of Xiang Yu’s advisors told him to assassinate Liu Bang at a well-­choreographed banquet, but Xiang lacked a killer’s instinct. His hesitation proved to be fatal for him.</p>

  <p class="text">Liu Bang’s diplomacy was a trap. A few years later, he returned in force and cornered Xiang Yu against a river, giving him nowhere to escape. The night before Xiang Yu was captured, he had his last drink with his favorite concubine. She performed her final dance for him with a sword and then killed herself as an act of loyalty.</p>

  <p class="text">Mao was taken with the themes of history expressed in “A Farewell to My Concubine”: beauty, love, heroism, power, politics, success, and failure. Referring to this tragedy, Mao warned his Communist colleagues never to make the same mistake as Xiang Yu. “When we get our momentum,” he said, “we shall carry on and eliminate our enemy. We will win the whole country.” So in April 1949, Mao issued a command for the People’s Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River and take over the southern part of China. On the evening he captured the capital Nanjing, he said, “We will never become complacent.” Mao, a <span aria-label="24" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tremendous romantic poet in his own right, wrote a poem on that night referring to the history of Xiang Yu.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">In addition to inspiring </span>leaders’ decisions, history can also act as a source of discipline for Chinese leaders, who are always deeply concerned with how their actions will be evaluated by future generations. As such, the weight of historical judgment acts as an informal accountability measure in the Chinese political system. This phenomenon was abundantly clear to me with my close observations of Premier Wen Jiabao in the lead-­up to the 2008 stimulus package.</p>

  <p class="text">The eyes of three hundred of China’s most influential figures were fixed on Premier Wen Jiabao as he began speaking about the economy. I looked to my left and saw the head of the <span class="italic">People’s Daily</span> (the most influential and official newspaper of China). Not far away sat the head of China’s nuclear industry, a former student at my school, the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, who was then the target of a corruption investigation (before eventually serving time). From the start, it was clear to me that this meeting with the premier was different from those I had attended on many previous occasions.</p>

  <p class="text">It was November 10, 2008, during the heart of the eruption of the global financial crisis following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. The premier was the main speaker, and the moderator was then-­executive premier and later premier Li Keqiang. I was asked to attend with virtually no notice and given no details about the meeting’s substance. I assumed it would be a meeting simply to discuss certain reform policies.</p>

  <p class="text">When I entered the room, I was shocked to see so many key decision makers: the governors of all thirty-­one provinces, directors of the provinces’ development and reform commissions, the CEOs of the largest state-­owned enterprises, and CEOs and chairmen of the largest commercial banks. Also in the audience <span aria-label="25" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25" role="doc-pagebreak"/>were the heads of China’s major media, including CCTV and the <span class="italic">People’s Daily</span>. And one scholar: me. My guess was that I was invited because I often publicly comment on China’s economic policies and might be considered an opinion maker regarding economics. In addition, I try to be as much of a nonbiased academic as possible, not involving myself in ideological debates or politics.</p>

  <p class="text">The venue of the meeting was a huge hall in the Western Beijing Hotel (Jing Xi Hotel). The meeting hall is virtually twice the size of the largest ballroom in any New York City five-­star hotel. This is where all the largest central government meetings have been held, including the all-­impor­tant Third Plenum of the Eleventh Party Congress in 1978, which began the era of reform and opening up. The hotel complex is massive, surrounded by military guards—­and only cars with the proper passes can enter.</p>

  <p class="text">Not only did the prominence of the attendees make it clear this was no ordinary meeting, so did the speaking style of the premier. The premier usually spoke slowly and deliberately, but this time his pace was noticeably quicker than it was at previous meetings I had attended. He was wearing a white dress shirt and black zip-­up jacket, the standard attire for informal meetings of Politburo members (the thirty-­plus-­member committee at the center of power of the Chinese Communist Party). He spent the first forty-­five minutes of his two-­hour talk explaining the huge challenges facing the economy, saying that industrial output and exports were declining, and that although the statistics did not appear too alarming at a glance, the negative trend they reflected was repeatedly emphasized by the premier. He said that this was an extreme situation facing the Chinese economy, and that action must be taken.</p>

  <p class="text">It was then that we discovered the reason for the meeting: The premier announced that the government would be rolling out a 4 trillion RMB (approximately 634 billion USD) stimulus for 2009 and 2010. I calculated on the spot that this was equal to 7.5 percent of GDP for each of the two years—­roughly the ratio of China’s <span aria-label="26" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26" role="doc-pagebreak"/>trade surplus to GDP. My quick inference was that the government assumed that the surplus might disappear completely, so it wanted to use the stimulus to offset that worst-­case scenario.</p>

  <p class="text">The premier continued that it was imperative to implement these policies immediately. He stressed the necessity of effective implementation, making an analogy to martial arts. “We will not behave like a showy martial artist (who pretends to be a master), whose moves are inaccurate, whose moves look good and are fancy but mellow in actual impact,” the premier said. “Rather, we want swift, accurate, powerful, and effective strikes.”</p>

  <p class="text">The entire room fell silent. Expressions of genuine shock could be seen on the faces of all three hundred attendees.</p>

  <p class="text">The premier continued in his stern tone and even waved his fist in the air as he spoke, an uncharacteristic display of emotion. He proclaimed that if the 4 trillion was not enough, the government “has more weapons available and will spend even more. We will do everything we have to in order to stop the decline of the economy.”</p>

  <p class="text">At this point, all attendees were frantically taking notes, trying to capture every word. This was especially true of the local government officials, who knew they would have to relay all this information to their colleagues in their home provinces. In addition, they could use many of the premier’s words to lobby or make requests to the central government for investment funds. A scene like this is rare, because often when top officials deliver impor­tant speeches, written notes are prepared and distributed for the attendees ahead of time. But in this case, the last-­minute urgency of the meeting did not permit this.</p>

  <p class="text">The meeting ended at 11:30, which is the usual end time for such gatherings. Chinese government officials wake up very early in the morning and are in the habit of eating an early lunch before a noontime nap, so I could already hear many stomachs growling.</p>

  <p class="text">As the attendees stood and prepared to file out of the room, many of them began whispering to each other, trying to digest <span aria-label="27" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27" role="doc-pagebreak"/>what they had just witnessed. Then, Executive Premier Li Keqiang announced that instead of going to lunch, the directors of the provincial reform and development commissions (the most powerful economic branch of a local government) were to go to a separate room and discuss how to implement the stimulus package.</p>

  <p class="text">Why was Premier Wen so anxious, intense, and seemingly paranoid as he rolled out the stimulus? History is the answer. He did not want to be recorded in history to be a slow-­acting decision maker facing a brewing crisis. His predecessor Premier Zhu Rongji was at the verge of committing such a mistake at the very beginning of the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Zhu had been in charge of the economy and had been focused on controlling economic overheating. Fortunately, Zhu quickly understood the character of the Asian financial crisis and rolled out a sequence of stimulus package reform policies, including a quadrupling of college enrollment.</p>

  <p class="text">It is quite clear that Premier Wen did not realize that years later the stimulus package would come under attack by Chinese economists, who blamed the policy for putting the Chinese economy heavily in debt. The debt to GDP ratio increased from 100 percent to over 250 percent between 2008 and 2015. My honest view is that any sensible person in his position would make the same decision. Facing the uncertainty, loss, and damage that would have come with choosing not to implement a stimulus package would have been too much to bear. I made this simple point during an interview with Chinese media in Washington, DC, in 2015 while attending a conference of the World Bank and IMF. When I returned to China, I received a phone call from the former premier’s office. Having retired for over two years at that point, he was seeking more evidence behind my argument. This is rare. China’s retired officials are not supposed to contact incumbent officials or active scholars and vice versa—­such dealings are perceived as interfering in the decision making of current <span aria-label="28" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28" role="doc-pagebreak"/>leaders. And yet, Wen Jiabao went out of his way to contact me. That shows me how concerned he is about the people’s assessment of his policy.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Over the past several years,</span> I could not help comparing Chinese leaders and their US counterparts about their sense of history. As I explained, Premier Wen Jiabao was very concerned about the lasting public response to the policies he enacted while in office. In contrast, when I had the chance to meet former US president George W. Bush, I found him to be almost the opposite. I moderated a virtual town hall meeting between a retired George W. Bush and the inaugural cohort of the Schwarzman Scholars, and the meeting went extremely well. As a private citizen, George W. Bush was relaxed, down to earth, and personable, and had a great sense of humor. When the students asked him difficult questions, such as how to deal with the crisis in Syria, his response was, “I don’t know. I need to consult the experts on this.” It was clear that he was enjoying his private life.</p>

  <p class="text">His openness and easygoing nature were surprising to me because if he were a Chinese leader, George W. Bush would not be able to enjoy his retirement so thoroughly. Rather, he would be constantly plagued with blame for the two unfortunate episodes that occurred on his watch: the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008. In other words, Western political systems place a much stronger singular focus on present leaders, with checks and balances built into the government to try to balance their authority. In China, history itself is a very impor­tant check on power: Current leaders have to think twice when making decisions, since the weight of history’s judgment constrains their behavior. In the United States, my observation is that when a president leaves office, all is gone. History will make judgments, but the president would not personally bear a heavy load of accountability. The presidential libraries are mostly <span aria-label="29" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for scholarly research and mostly not the center of current political debates.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Most Chinese people are </span>accustomed to having a long-­term view and perceiving history in cycles. In ancient Chinese history, it was common to have a powerful empire ruling the country for a few hundred years, followed by a period of civil war or foreign invasion, chaos, and breakup into small kingdoms. The cycle would then repeat as the country was reunited again, sometimes with the help of external invaders, as was the case with the Yuan Dynasty (under the Mongolians) and the last Chinese dynasty, the Qing Dynasty founded by the Manchurians from northeastern China. Thus, many Chinese people observe big-­picture patterns as they view the sweep of history.</p>

  <p class="text">From the long-­term historical view, most Chinese believe that today China is in the rising part of a cycle following the “century of humiliation” from 1840 (the Opium War) to 1945 (the end of the Japanese invasion). The last emperors of the final dynasty got into deep troubles dealing with Western powers and were forced to sign a sequence of treaties, known as the unequal treaties, authorizing concessions. Then the Nationalist Party overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, establishing the Republic of China. Unfortunately, this regime proved unsuccessful at uniting the country and addressing social problems such as inequality. China remained in disarray until the Communist Party assumed national power in 1949, and from this historical perspective, the Communist Party is recognized as a hero among many people of China. The century of humiliation is fresh in their memory, and this contributes to the popularity of Xi Jinping’s calls for China to revive itself and reclaim its place as a well-­respected and powerful country.</p>

  <p class="text">A very popular belief in China is that five hundred years ago, China’s economy was the biggest and most prosperous in the world. This statement grossly overstates the glory of China’s <span aria-label="30" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30" role="doc-pagebreak"/>economic history. Over the past decade, my coauthor, Professor Guan Hanhui of Peking University, and I have spent several years estimating the total size of the historical Chinese economy. In modern economic terms, the total size of an economy is measured by the gross domestic product (GDP). We spent years exploring the archives of the Chinese national library, recording the physical output of grain, paper, iron, coal, and artistic items such as porcelain, to reconstruct the total GDP of various Chinese dynasties. Prior to our research, scholars such as the late Angus Madison had to guess China’s per capita income and multiply this figure by the size of the population, yielding grossly inaccurate results.</p>

  <p class="text">Our findings were shocking: The per capita income of China began to decline one thousand years ago, dating back to the Song Dynasty. From 980 until 1840, the beginning of China’s modern history, the per capita income of the Chinese economy declined despite an increase in total output, which grew at a rate of 0.35 percent. The reason for this was very simple: The rapid increase in population outpaced the growth of arable land and capital, so that on the per capita level, capital and land were declining. Furthermore, the productivity of labor did not increase significantly in the ancient Chinese economy. With the chronic decline in per capita income, extreme poverty and a surplus of agricultural labor took root.</p>

  <p class="text">Based on our calculations, by 1775, China’s per capita income was only 30 percent of that of the UK. Our conclusion has a clear implication: There was no way for China to have developed its own Industrial Revolution, since labor was so abundant that it did not allow for the invention of labor-­saving technologies.</p>

  <p class="text">Against this backdrop of economic stagnation, the encounter between China and modern Western civilization proved to be disastrous for the Chinese, starting with the Opium War of 1840–1842. In a sequence of unequal treaties that ended lost wars, the Qing emperors gave up the island of Hong Kong to Britain, the city of Qingdao to Germany, Taiwan to Japan, and a huge area of land <span aria-label="31" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in the northern region as large as Germany, France, and the UK combined to tsarist Russia.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the past 180 years, generation after generation of social elites and politicians have debated and advocated for their own vision of how a modern China should emerge from its humiliating confrontations with Western civilization. Almost all Chinese leaders believe that unless the country makes itself stronger, it will again fall victim to more advanced nations and powers. Among all leaders, Deng Xiaoping put it most succinctly: “When we remain backward, we will be beaten again, economically, militarily, and eventually culturally, and China will lose its identity in the world.” This belief, bordering on paranoia, is behind the politics practiced during the past thirty-­plus years of rapid growth.</p>

  <p class="text">Attitudes toward China’s historical humiliations inform contemporary stances on Taiwan and Hong Kong. Both Taiwan and Hong Kong are immensely impor­tant for mainland Chinese leaders, who enjoy unimaginable support from the population on these issues. Why? The answer does not stem from pure economics or geopolitics, but from history. Taiwan was first taken away from mainland China after the First Sino-­Japanese War of 1895, when it was ceded to Japan as part of a huge war settlement. At the end of World War II, Japan was forced to give up Taiwan to mainland China. In 1949, Chiang Kai-­shek’s Nationalist government retreated from the mainland to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War. Chiang Kai-­shek intended to use Taiwan as a base for a comeback to mainland China in a continuation of the Civil War, but of course he never realized his dream. Since then, both the Communists and the Nationalists have claimed to be the only legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan. In recent years, the situation has gotten increasingly tense as popular sentiment on Taiwan has shown a growing call for independence from the mainland, with provocative support from certain foreign governments. Why is this such a sensitive issue? To the people in the mainland, Taiwan is a deep historical wound stemming <span aria-label="32" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from abuse by Western powers and Japan, and it has never had a chance to heal. A simple analogy would be if the United States had lost Hawaii to Japan during World War II. Until Hawaii could be reunited with the United States, this episode of the war would never end.</p>

  <p class="text">The issue of Hong Kong can be understood in a very similar way. The colonization of Hong Kong by the UK was the very beginning of the century of humiliation. That’s why any indication of Hong Kong moving toward independence rips open yet another deep wound, bringing historical trauma to the surface. As a result, China has been extremely strict about not tolerating any foreign influence or undue comments from other countries about the issue of Hong Kong.</p>

  <p class="text">To a Western observer and many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong, self-­determination is a natural right. However, to most of the people on the mainland, history matters. The determination to bring Taiwan and Hong Kong under the mainland’s sovereignty, which is a tricky and sophisticated concept, is paramount. Anything besides sovereignty can be discussed. In fact, the mainland government has offered Taiwan authority to keep its army and keep everything unchanged so long as Taiwan comes back to the sovereignty of the mainland. As for Hong Kong, all political reforms can be worked out so long as it does not elect leaders calling for Hong Kong’s independence from the mainland.</p>

  <p class="text">How do most Chinese view the United States from a historical perspective? At a risk of oversimplification, my observation is that most people recognize that the United States is and remains the most powerful and domineering country in the world. In contrast, most people believe that historically, China never ruled or conquered the world, even during powerful dynasties. Instead, powerful dynasties successfully fended off invasions, mostly from the north, and then made peace with the invaders by various means, including marrying off royal princesses to heads of the northern powers. Bringing this historical experience to the <span aria-label="33" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33" role="doc-pagebreak"/>present day, many Chinese believe that today’s rising China should fight back against any US-­led efforts to contain China, especially on issues like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China’s claimed sovereignty over certain islands in the South China Sea. Once China is able to successfully counter US containment policies, China will make efforts to facilitate peace with the United States and its allies. Marrying out Chinese princesses is not an option, as times have changed. But there are far more alternatives today, including social and economic collaborations. It is impor­tant for the world to understand these popular Chinese views based on Chinse history.</p>

  <p class="text">What is the most visible impact of history on today’s China? The answer has to do with the Chinese Communist Party. It is the world’s largest and soon-­to-­be longest-­ruling party, with a unique approach to sociopolitical governance. The party is a product of Chinese history, and it is arguably the most impor­tant key to understanding today’s China. This is the topic I turn to next.</p>
