  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n order to understand how the Chinese economy operates, it is essential to understand the relationship between the economy and the government. Government intervention is pervasive in many aspects of the Chinese economy, which Westerners commonly believe to be a defect. However, if this were truly a flaw, the Chinese economy would not have been able to grow so rapidly for such a long period of time. Moreover, in the past four decades of rapid growth, China has successfully avoided a financial crisis, which accompanied each of the historical episodes of rapid economic growth in the United States, Japan, Germany, and Korea.</p>

  <p class="text">The relationship between the government and the market has been undergoing gradual changes during the past four decades, mostly moving toward letting the market play a more impor­tant role, with the government standing by when the market fails. China is a great laboratory in this regard, and its experiences hold lessons for many countries, including Western market economies. Even today, the consensus in Chinese society is that the government-­market relationship still needs rebalancing. To understand the general picture, I start by explaining the rationale behind the Chinese government’s intervention in the economy.</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="98" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Why does China’s government, </span>in contrast to governments in most other countries, intervene extensively in the economy and society? There are fundamental and philosophical reasons for this. The first can be summarized as all-­responsible government, which means that the government believes that it should behave like a parent, with the general public regarded as children who expect to be taken care of. This philosophy can be traced back to Confucianism—­Confucius argued that subjects should be loyal to their emperor, and, in return, the emperor must be benevolent toward his subjects.</p>

  <p class="text">The mentality of the all-­responsible government is vividly illustrated by the fact that each level of Chinese government includes a department called the grievance agency. When people believe they have been mistreated either by lower-­level governments, local enterprises, other individuals, or society in general, they can line up at the agency’s door to have their voices heard. These individuals often write lengthy statements detailing how they have been wronged, and sometimes even cut their fingers to sign them in their own blood. This is different from a court, where the adversary system exists. Even though China does have a court system, many still believe in the grievance system, where the government is the final renderer of justice.</p>

  <p class="text">As an implication of the philosophy of all-­responsible government, the government tends to intervene more in areas where it feels a large number of households or citizens might be wounded. For example, the government intervenes much more in the commercial banking sector than in the private equity sector. This is because many households place their money in a bank, whereas investors in the private equity market comprise a relatively low proportion of the population. Furthermore, a person must prove that they have significant assets in order to invest in private equity. Therefore, if a problem were to occur with a large commercial bank, it would negatively affect a large number of <span aria-label="99" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99" role="doc-pagebreak"/>households, many without much net worth outside of their bank savings. In contrast, private equity firms usually involve a small number of high-­net-­worth individuals with less of a need for government protection.</p>

  <p class="text">Consistent with the philosophy of all-­responsible government is that often, government intervention is directly motivated by the desire to avert massive protests or demonstrations. The government worries that if a large number of people lose money or jobs, they will take to the streets in protest. Such events would never occur if only a handful of high-­net-­worth people were to lose money. In that instance, they might go to the government to conduct closed-­door negotiations. This would be a more comfortable scenario for the government than mass demonstrations.</p>

  <p class="text">The second philosophy regarding extensive government intervention is based on the belief that the good of society takes priority over an individual’s welfare. Again, this concept can be traced back to Confucius’s political philosophy. On the global stage, the American political philosophy sits at one extreme, placing great emphasis on individual liberty. This concept can be traced back to English and Scottish philosophers. In contrast, some continental European philosophers have historically placed relatively more emphasis on social order than individual liberty. The Chinese government goes one step beyond that idea: When it comes to making major decisions, effecting social stability and economic prosperity are more impor­tant than ensuring individual rights.</p>

  <p class="text">China’s policies regarding motorcycle ownership and usage provide a good example of the prioritization of social order over individual liberty, forming a sharp contrast to those in the United States, where, for example, gun ownership is largely legalized. Since the early 1990s, all major cities in China have either completely banned motorcycles or strictly limited the issuance of motorcycle registration licenses. Moreover, most highways prohibit motorcycles from entering. Why? The reasons given by the government are that motorcycles are unsafe for the riders, are <span aria-label="100" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100" role="doc-pagebreak"/>intrusive for pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, and—­most impor­tantly—­are oftentimes used by criminals. Therefore, in the interest of the general public, motorcycles are banned in almost all cities. The city of Beijing is relatively more friendly to motorcycles: Instead of having a complete ban, only about ten thousand class A motorcycle registration licenses are allowed, whose market value had gone up as high as 60,000 US dollars each by early 2023. As a fan of motorcycles, I have been arguing for and proposing the elimination of restrictions on motorcycles and have written many policy proposals for this. So far, I have not been successful. Considering that in the United States, gun ownership is legal, many of my friends agree that both countries have gone to extremes.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">No single government agency </span>in China more vividly illustrates how the Chinese government works with the economy than the NDRC, the National Development and Reform Commission. The NDRC is easily China’s busiest central government agency. Most of the one-­thousand-­plus officials work overtime perennially, and one of my former schoolmates had a stroke at the age of fifty due to overwork there. The NDRC boasts thirteen directors and deputy directors. The first of the NDRC’s major functions is to monitor China’s macroeconomic operations. Semiannually, the NDRC produces an analysis of the macroeconomy and forms policy responses and suggestions for China’s top leadership. I am occasionally invited to meet with NDRC directors, deputy directors, and, on occasion, directors of individual NDRC departments to discuss how to best analyze the macroeconomy, how to carry out policies, and how to decide which measures will best facilitate the smooth operation of the economy.</p>

  <p class="text">In economic and many other social affairs, the NDRC wields a significant amount of power. In fact, the head of the NDRC is a half-­step above the heads of other ministries. The structure of <span aria-label="101" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the NDRC includes several major departments that are responsible for tasks such as monitoring the Chinese macroeconomy (much like the US Department of the Treasury), formulating policies in various industries, and keeping tabs on the markets for resources such as electricity, gas, and coal to prevent any shortages. The NDRC also has a large economic research complex, a department in charge of approving and managing super-­large investment projects, and a department working on issues related to global warming.</p>

  <p class="text">The NDRC is well known among many economists across the world and has won praise by liberal (as opposed to free-­market) economists. I recall that in 2010, after walking out of a high-­level workshop on the world economy at the International Monetary Fund headquarters, a world-­renowned US economist told me: “You are from China and your comments just now were the most optimistic among everyone in the room because you have an NDRC. I wish the US had thirteen NDRCs!”</p>

  <p class="text">The directors and deputy directors of the NDRC often boast rich experiences in local or other government agencies, but are usually modest in personality and adept at synthesizing different views and coordinating conflicting interests. Former director Mr. Zhang Ping is a prime example. In the winter of 2012, I was in an NDRC conference room with about twenty people. Seated across the table facing me was Mr. Zhang, the director at the time, along with two deputy directors and his chief of staff. Seated next to me were seven fellow academics. I had already finished my presentation, which analyzed the macroeconomic situation and included my policy proposal. The last speaker was a professor from Renmin University. He gave a long lecture, citing Keynes, Milton Friedman, and so on. He spoke for twenty minutes without coming close to analyzing the Chinese economy. The chief of staff clearly grew very impatient, as did the other academics. The chief of staff stood up and interjected, asking the speaker to please make his points and finish as quickly as possible, saying that it was time <span aria-label="102" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for us to have lunch and that the director needed to take a nap after lunch. Mr. Zhang patiently waved his hand to his assistant and said to the professor, “Take your time, professor. Please continue.” Mr. Zhang is a polite, mild-­mannered, and modest person who pays close attention to details. This apparently is the style of all NDRC directors. Mr. Zhang’s predecessor, Mr. Ma Kai, who later became the vice premier of China in charge of finance, possesses the same style, as do most of the others. They are all experts at coordinating various interests and views on the economy.</p>

  <p class="text">Each ministry has its own culture of behavior, and that of the NDRC is surely modesty and caution. This is because the NDRC, as a powerful and coordinating agency, often has to play the role of the “bad guy,” rejecting lobbying from other agencies. For example, the Ministry of Industry and Information may push for government investments in the high-­tech industry, while the Ministry of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Management pushes for investments in building and repairing reservoirs. Being pulled in many different directions, the NDRC must remain firmly in the middle, balancing all competing requirements. NDRC officials must be mild-­mannered and ensure that they can politely reject requests without damaging relationships. Imagine if the situation were reversed—­if the director of the NDRC, which is by far China’s most powerful agency—­wielded its power to eliminate many projects. People would complain, the director would draw the enmity of the other ministries, and sooner or later, the minister would be forced out of politics. The recent mild-­mannered and modest directors have all received promotions, later becoming either a vice premier or deputy chairman of the CPPCC, a political body similar to Britain’s House of Lords.</p>

  <p class="text">Young talents compete to get into the NDRC, and its young staff members have a very active, proud, and studious culture. I was once invited to sit on the jury for an annual economic essay and speech competition for young NDRC staff. I found this experience highly interesting because the young staff members were <span aria-label="103" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_103" role="doc-pagebreak"/>all tremendously enthusiastic and hardworking. They came up with numerous thought-­provoking ideas regarding economic regulation, and I could tell their opinions were valued, as all of the NDRC directors were in attendance when the finalists gave their presentations. As a jury member, I provided feedback to the essayists and then voted for the best. During this experience, I found the young people at the NDRC to be extremely ambitious, perceiving themselves as the managers of the entire economy (and possibly as future premiers). Many of them have master’s or even PhD degrees in economics or business. They passionately discuss and often criticize China’s policies pertaining to population and land, as well as other major issues, and truly feel they can effect change.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">What are the major </span>areas of the economy that are still under extensive government intervention, either directly or indirectly? The first area is <span class="bold">prices of goods and services that are socially sensitive,</span> ranging from household electricity and gasoline, to school tuition, to medical surgery. This is especially the case during economically and politically sensitive periods. For example, gasoline, diesel, and natural gas prices are government-­regulated, which is under the purview of the NDRC. The government has published a formula linking the average international price of crude oil over the previous ten days, in addition to other variables, to the announced gasoline price. However, they do not always strictly follow this formula, so there are still surprises. Chinese gasoline prices are among the lowest in the world, only slightly higher than those in the United States. There are sound political reasons for the government to keep prices low: China is now the world’s largest automobile market in terms of sales (around twenty-­seven million) and ownership (around 270 million by June 2022) and is still growing. For comparison, US annual sales fluctuate around thirteen million to eighteen million units, and total <span aria-label="104" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ownership is at 260 million. Any call to potentially raise gasoline taxes will ignite public complaints against the government. In this regard, China and the United States are the same. However, economists generally disagree with the practice of gas price regulation as it encourages overreliance on fossil energy.</p>

  <p class="text">The tuition for executive MBA programs is also regulated by the NDRC. An executive MBA is a part-­time MBA program offered to business executives. Of course, EMBA (Executive MBA) programs are also offered by US and European business schools. Chinese business schools have found that EMBA programs are very useful not only in boosting the schools’ revenue but also in adding some of the country’s most successful businesspeople to their alumni network. But since the tuition fees are quite high—­around 100,000 USD for a two-­year program—­an uproar erupted on social media and the internet at large, saying that elite universities were being too greedy. As a result, the NDRC stepped in and began regulating tuition prices. The rationale for regulation is political: The government does not want to be accused of allowing state-­owned universities to collect what are perceived to be exorbitant fees. Again, most economists and elites disagree with the NDRC in regulating tuition, arguing that this is a subsidy for high-­income executives.</p>

  <p class="text"><span class="bold">Large investment projects </span>are also under NDRC control, which is perhaps one of the most unique aspects of the Chinese economy. The rationale for controlling or promoting major investments is to prevent the economy from becoming too cool or too hot. In recent years, this practice was also intended to prevent overcapacity in production—­a problem that plagues China’s aluminum, iron, steel, and power-­generation industries. When prices of iron and steel drop very low, many enterprises in this field are unprofitable. Yet, there are still entrepreneurs willing to gamble by building factories in these sectors. They believe they have either unique technologies or superior operating models. The entrepreneurs may well be rational based on their own interest, since when <span aria-label="105" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105" role="doc-pagebreak"/>their projects work, they benefit, and when their projects fail, it is workers, local governments, and banks that suffer. Also, existing enterprises, including foreign producers, suffer due to lower prices caused by the new projects. Therefore, the central government issues a ban on new projects in certain sectors when prices are too low or when the government believes the production capacity is already too high. Such bans can be very tough. In 2003, for instance, a private entrepreneur was imprisoned for violating the central government’s ban on building new iron and steel plants.</p>

  <p class="text">Because of the practice of restricting large investment projects, it is said that the drawers in the NDRC offices are filled with applications from local governments and private entrepreneurs seeking to make investments in various sectors. One implication is that the NDRC can quickly jumpstart the economy by loosening its control of projects. For example, subway construction requires approval from the NDRC to prevent local governments from becoming overly burdened by debt. Around 2012, cities with a population of at least three million could successfully apply for a subway, but now, when the economy slows down, projects in some cities with a population of less than three million are being approved.</p>

  <p class="text">You may think that multinationals hate the NDRC for its policy of controlling new projects. The fact is often the opposite! This is because multinationals usually have higher thresholds of profitability and environmental impact, so their projects usually pass the NDRC quickly. They are grateful to the NDRC for stopping other projects by domestic players, since they often complain about Chinese private investors’ aggressive investment in relevant sectors, which causes industrial prices to drop exceptionally low.</p>

  <p class="text"><span class="bold">Product standards</span> are another area under extensive government regulation, usually supervised by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information. In this regard, China and the United States follow opposite philosophies. In China, to sell a product on the market, the producer often must first gain approval from the <span aria-label="106" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106" role="doc-pagebreak"/>government by passing a standard. In the United States, producers can often <a id="_idTextAnchor001"/>begin selling immediately without approval, but if the product is later believed to be unsafe, the producer may face lawsuits, which often result in paying extremely high compensation, and ultimately in bankruptcy. In China, when a product is unsafe, consumers will go after the government (rather than the producer) via the grievance protocol. Not aware of the difference between China and the United States, in 2022, many Chinese electric vehicle producers were considering entering the US market, and I often suggested they be cautious and well prepared before making any commitments.</p>

  <p class="text">Partly to avoid problems of product liability, China often has very high technical thresholds for consumer products, at least on paper. China’s product standards are often among the world’s highest, similar to those of the United States and Europe. However, the implementation and enforcement of these standards is the problem. I was told by a friend that only about 30 percent of China’s motorcycles meet national emission standards because manufacturers, seeking to reduce costs, send their best samples for inspection, later assembling substandard products for volume production. In the United States and Europe, random checking by the government curbs this practice.</p>

  <p class="text"><span class="bold">The property market</span> is another area with which the Chinese government is deeply concerned. In places like the United States, Hong Kong, or the UK, when property prices are very high, the government raises interest rates, and banks might also take some measures to tighten their supply of credit. Unfortunately, the United States did not take such actions before the financial crisis, allowing the property market to spin out of control. In the Chinese case, all of these measures have been attempted, but they are often not sufficient, and as a result, property prices have kept rising. By 2011, the central government urged local governments to take the drastic step of rationing the purchase of apartments. For example, each household in Beijing can now purchase only <span aria-label="107" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_107" role="doc-pagebreak"/>two pieces of property. In order to buy property, households must demonstrate that in the past two years, they have been legally residing in Beijing and paying their taxes. Foreigners can only buy property in Beijing after living in the city and paying local taxes for at least five years. The policy has helped stabilize Beijing’s housing prices, but of course, such a draconian policy often draws attacks by economists for being antimarket.</p>

  <p class="text"><span class="bold">Stock prices</span> are another area subject to active government intervention. Whenever stock prices were extremely high during the past two decades, the <span class="italic">People’s Daily</span>, China’s official newspaper, published editorials urging investors to be cautious, consistent with the philosophy of all-­responsible government. Such editorials would often be seen as countersignals for many smart investors who used them as indicators that the market was not only currently hot, but would also remain hot for some time, making “now” a good time to invest. Thus, the government failed to sufficiently persuade people, and more cash was pumped into the stock market. When market prices are high, the government encourages IPOs in order to cool down market prices. Conversely, when the stock market is low, the government tends to ban IPOs. In most countries, investment banks and enterprises decide when to pursue an IPO, but in China, this decision is under government regulation. The government feels that addressing the excesses of the stock market is the government’s responsibility.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Is government intervention in </span>the economy ultimately successful in China? This is a very difficult and controversial question. My simple answer is that intervention has been successful for the purpose of preventing drastic economic crises, including financial crises. However, for the purpose of developing individual industries, government intervention has been much less successful. This is why there have been conscious efforts to gradually let market forces play a larger role in the economy.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="108" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108" role="doc-pagebreak"/>One major reason for successfully avoiding a major economic crisis is that the premier’s office is very much focused on China’s macroeconomic operation and market fluctuations. In most countries, these issues are the responsibility of entities akin to the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, while in China they reach much higher in the leadership, and are personally overseen by the premier. Every six months, the premier convenes meetings with academic and business experts to discuss the macroeconomy. I have attended many of these meetings, during which the premier usually asks each expert to speak for about ten minutes and then responds and explains his ideas regarding managing the economy. At one of these meetings in July 2014, the concern was the economic slowdown. I proposed that China follow the practice of the World Bank by setting up investment funds and issuing debt to support long-­term infrastructure investment. The practice at that time was to have commercial banks support long-­term projects, thus crowding out enterprises from the credit market. The premier immediately asked whether this would invoke a larger government deficit. Apparently, the premier is very concerned with the budget deficit because every March he faces the scrutiny of the National People’s Congress.</p>

  <p class="text">At the level of individual industries, intervention by the central government, as well as by many local governments, has mixed results. When governments see too much production in an industry or when they try to promote an industry, they tend to choose some individual enterprises to cut or subsidize. That is, they are like an NBA general manager picking the basketball players in a draft. Although there are successful stories, in many cases they choose the wrong enterprises. Most of today’s industry champions were not chosen by governments but instead emerged as the victors through competition. For example, China’s home appliance producer Haier was on the verge of being forced to close down by the central government in the late 1990s, when the home appliance industry was plagued by overproduction. Fortunately, <span aria-label="109" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Haier fought hard to stay in the industry and excelled, while many chosen producers failed and later were liquidated. Some good local governments know this well and behave like an organizer of a sports tournament to stimulate firms to compete and then hand the trophy to the winner. China’s Huawei, Xiaomi, Ali­baba, and so forth, all follow this model. Local governments such as those of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, or Hangzhou function as tournament managers.</p>

  <p class="text">After understanding the motivation and behavior of government in the economy, in the next chapters, we move closer to the economy by examining different types of Chinese enterprises in order to understand why Chinese industries have been growing rapidly over the past decades. We start with state-­owned enterprises, whose existence and behavior have aroused many questions outside China.</p>
