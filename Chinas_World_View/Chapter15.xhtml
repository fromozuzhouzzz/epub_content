  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_15"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter15"><span class="running-head">Is There a <br/>“Chinese Model”?</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y this point in the book, you might naturally ask: Is China following its own model of sociopolitical governance? That is, is there a Chinese model; is China different from the West; and is China’s strength and influence likely to continue rising? To answer this question, I may surprise you by explaining that many Chinese scholars are not willing to discuss such a question, since they feel that there are still many problems to be worked out and thus it is too early for China to settle down with a set of institutions. Also, even if there will be a Chinese model, it would be highly unlikely for China to brand it and export it to the rest of the world, since leaders in China know very well that Chinese cultural and historical settings make such a job impossible. Given all these factors, I go through three pillars of what can be called the Chinese approach to sociopolitical governance: all-­responsible government with a matching social mentality, internal discipline within the government, and respect-­centered rather than ideology-­centered or interest-­centered diplomacy.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">In Western academic and </span>policy circles, there is a great deal of buzz around the concept of the “Chinese Model” or the “Beijing Consensus,” meaning China’s approach toward sociopolitical governance, which could serve as a template for other countries. Many people outside China may expect that Chinese <span aria-label="199" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199" role="doc-pagebreak"/>scholars and political insiders are extremely proud of the achievements of their country over the past four decades, and that they must discuss the “Chinese Model” enthusiastically on a daily basis. On the contrary, many if not most Chinese scholars and many government officials are actually very reluctant to discuss this topic, or you even might say are “allergic” to it. Furthermore, the debate surrounding the “Chinese Model” is highly divisive among Chinese elites today.</p>

  <p class="text">Why are many Chinese scholars, especially those in social sciences and humanities, so allergic to this topic? One obvious reason is that China is evolving rapidly, and all scholars, especially those in the social sciences, have their own ideas about how the country should change. Many are not pleased with China’s current situation and are hoping to see continued progress. I remember a few years ago when I met one of my father’s former colleagues who was in his eighties and a well-­read and thoughtful former government official. When he asked what project I was working on, I replied that I was writing a book on the economic development of China as a large country. He pleaded with me, “Please do not talk about a Chinese model. We are still improving and it’s still too early to talk about a Chinese model.” He didn’t want the younger generation to become complacent. He insisted on continuing to discuss the problems that existed, but he didn’t believe we had a “model.”</p>

  <p class="text">Many of my close friends in academia and government echo the concerns of this former official. Their advice is: “Don’t talk about a Chinese model. Talk about the Chinese experience, but if you talk about a Chinese model then you are justifying a lot of bad things that are in practice today.”</p>

  <p class="text">While the Chinese people have a large and growing amount of confidence and pride in their country, many higher expectations still exist. The Chinese people want changes. One example of this attitude can be seen with regard to education. Outside China, the Chinese precollege education system is frequently praised for its <span aria-label="200" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200" role="doc-pagebreak"/>high levels of achievement in math, natural sciences, and even in English learning. In a survey conducted by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which compares the quality of academic achievements of high school students worldwide, Shanghai consistently ranks number one or two. China’s precollege education is held in such high esteem that some Chinese teachers are even invited to teach in the UK. Yet if you ask a Chinese parent or a high school student, they all complain, and nobody says the education system is wonderful. They argue that there is too much competition and the study requirements are too demanding. But they do not offer any solutions. At the same time, there are numerous articles on the Chinese internet discussing how elite American high schools are so superior to their Chinese counterparts, citing the school Mark Zuckerberg attended (Phillips Exeter Academy). They argue that Zuckerberg was already well educated before attending Harvard (from which he famously dropped out to pursue the development of Facebook).</p>

  <p class="text">Another example about which many Chinese people feel there is a need for improvement is that China does not have any revolutionary entrepreneurs like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Elon Musk. Although there are great Chinese companies and entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba, people in China often argue that American entrepreneurs have changed the lives of people around the world. Chinese society must be more open and accommodating to allow such geniuses to emerge.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There are generally two </span>opposing camps within China regarding whether there is a Chinese model. One believes the only meaningful model of political and social governance in the world is Western liberal democracy. This model espouses a certain set of universal values, including individual liberty and social equality. I have many respected and personal friends belonging to this camp. The proponents of this model believe these goals <span aria-label="201" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201" role="doc-pagebreak"/>can only be achieved through Western democracy. They tend to be people born in the 1940s and 1950s who endured suffering during the Cultural Revolution as teenagers. So far, they seem to be the mainstream of the intellectual community if not of the whole society. When they argue for their views, they often focus on the problems of Chinese society and cite the United States as an example of social progress. You may think these scholars, many of whom are members of the Communist Party, would lose their jobs. In fact, most of them do not so long as they refrain from openly attacking top leaders. Again, this reflects how today’s China is different from the former Soviet Union.</p>

  <p class="text">The second camp argues that China should evolve into a system featuring strictly Chinese characteristics. People in this camp maintain that China needs to improve, progress, and innovate, while at the same time taking into account Chinese history and Chinese culture. In the process, the argument goes, China may provide other countries with a solution in their efforts to modernize. Let’s call this the camp of Chinese characteristics. So far, scholars in social sciences and liberal arts holding this view are relatively few in number but often are highly visible. In China, they are often labeled as leftist scholars.</p>

  <p class="text">I am not regarded as either an extreme rightist or leftist—­I am usually perceived to be a moderate scholar. As a result, over the past one-­and-­a-­half decades, I have been able to reach out to both camps and organize many closed-­door sessions in my research center to discuss current policy issues, such as how to deal with China-­US trade frictions. As the host and moderator at these events, I make special efforts to involve both camps. Discussions are usually very heated, with “leftist” scholars in the minority. On one or two occasions, some of them have even walked out of the room in protest. In such cases, I had to make special efforts to apologize to upset scholars and appease their anger. I have to say that I have learned more from the “leftist” scholars, since they have to work harder to convince the <span aria-label="202" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202" role="doc-pagebreak"/>audience and present more evidence, while the “rightists” often just rely on what they call general common sense, such as the idea that democracy and rule of law are better than autocracy or authoritarian regimes.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There is a very </span>popular idea among Western scholars that when a country is economically better off, with a per capita income above $10,000, then Western-­style democracy will emerge as the only model of sociopolitical governance. Favored examples of this in the East Asian region include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Even in China, the renowned CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria once eloquently summarized this popular view. This was during a seminar in December of 2013, organized by a very senior advisor to a top Chinese political leader, who invited many influential Western scholars and opinion leaders to participate in dialogues with their Chinese counterparts. Unfortunately, the senior Chinese host was only reading his prepared notes, and the event was getting very boring. It was pushing lunchtime and as a world-­class TV personality, Zakaria could not stand this extremely low efficiency of exchange. Thus, he broke out into a three-­minute speech in which he argued that there is no historical exception to the rule that when people get rich, they will fight for democracy. Furthermore, he pointed out that mainland China is surrounded by such examples: Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Fareed politely suggested that the Chinese authorities should prepare to face this phenomenon as China becomes increasingly prosperous.</p>

  <p class="text">Despite the appealing logic of this argument, especially when relayed by someone as well-­spoken as Fareed Zakaria, the conclusion that economic prosperity leads to Western-­style democracy is far too simplistic. The argument misses two extremely crucial points. First, geopolitics. In all of the examples cited by Zakaria, the political influence of the West has been extremely impor­tant. In the case of Japan, after it lost World War II and was occupied <span aria-label="203" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203" role="doc-pagebreak"/>by the United States, the Japanese constitution was drafted by two US military lawyers. In the cases of South Korea and Taiwan, the political elites sensed imminent threats from their respective military and political enemies and therefore felt compelled to conform to the US political system in order to strengthen military alliances. The former Taiwanese leader Chiang Ching-­kuo famously asked his advisor in 1979: “Now that the US has abandoned us and established formal diplomatic relations with mainland China, how can we protect ourselves?” His advisor said, “Clearly, the only option is to become a democracy so that the US will protect us.” Chiang started the process of democracy gradually by first opening up local elections and then the presidential election, much as in the US model.</p>

  <p class="text">The second set of variables refuting the view that economic development leads to Western-­style democracy include culture and history. Culturally, many countries in Central and Eastern Europe that transitioned to democracy in the late twentieth century identify strongly with Western ideals due to their European identity. In Poland, for instance, which made the transition from communism to democracy in 1989, people perceive themselves as part of Europe. Historically, in such democracies as India and the Philippines, current political systems were strongly influenced by their former colonial rulers. In contrast with these examples, China is too large, too proud, and too independent to conform to the Western model. China was a unified, self-­governing country for most of the past thousands of years. Unlike Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, mainland China has never been under US protection and there is no need to prove itself as a genuine friend of the United States by importing Western political and economic systems and institutions in wholesale fashion.</p>

  <p class="text">Furthermore, on the topic of culture and political thinking, one must recognize that Confucianism has been the dominant sociopolitical philosophy in China for over two thousand years. From an early age, Chinese students are taught to memorize <span aria-label="204" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" role="doc-pagebreak"/>classic stories conveying the values of Confucianism. They are educated to be obedient to their parents and told to respect social order and to follow the instructions of their teachers at school. As a result, Chinese people tend to rely on their parents first and then the government to solve their problems.</p>

  <p class="text">Perhaps the most impor­tant historical factor is the Chinese revolution and the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party. As explained previously, the party’s original motivation was nation-­building rather than promoting communism as an ideology. For the sake of improving public relations with the rest of the world, many scholars have suggested that the party should remove the word <span class="italic">communist</span> from its name. However, popular Chinese culture favors continuity, and due to domestic considerations, the title of “communist” has been kept. The party came to power through more than two decades of brutal warfare and has become extremely pragmatic and adaptive in battling many different enemies. In addition, the party made disastrous mistakes in the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and is now extremely cautious and willing to adapt in order to stay in power. However, despite this flexibility, simply copying the model of multiparty political competition from Western liberal democracies is not on the menu. As previously explained, the party and the government are integrated in China, so having a new party running the government would create tremendous chaos.</p>

  <p class="text">China had an unsuccessful experiment with the system of village level democracy around the year 2000, when popular elections were introduced into Chinese villages—­an event met with great enthusiasm from Americans, including representatives of the Jimmy Carter Foundation. However, democracy in Chinese villages quickly devolved into a brazen attempt by large families sharing the same last name to exploit minority families because Chinese villages had long been organized as kingships. As a result, that experiment today is widely perceived to have been unsuccessful, and the party has reinstated its involvement in the <span aria-label="205" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205" role="doc-pagebreak"/>governance of villages. This establishes basic stability and fairness in the villages.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Regardless of whether there </span>will be a Chinese model, three impor­tant features stand out in the Chinese approach to sociopolitical governance.</p>

  <p class="text">The first feature is perhaps the most noteworthy, that is, an all-­responsible government with matching expectations of the population. An all-­responsible government is a government attempting to guard the welfare of its people. Such a government knows that if it does not perform up to the expectations of the population, it will be ousted from politics one way or another. As the Chinese top leaders starting with Mao have always said, “We are taking exams with the people giving the exam questions.” This is why Chinese leaders are always worried and even paranoid about many socioeconomic issues.</p>

  <p class="text">I use the term <span class="italic">all</span><span class="italic">-­responsible government</span> as a neutral description of the Chinese system of sociopolitical governance. The Chinese government’s motto is “serve the people,” and it often takes many of the people’s responsibilities onto its own shoulders. A similar term is <span class="italic">paternalistic government</span>, which was coined by my former Harvard professor, Janos Kornai, to criticize the behavior of the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies. He compared the behavior of those governments to the way that parents treat small children, leaving not enough room for freedom.</p>

  <p class="text">A good example of all-­responsible government can be seen in its cautious attitude toward financial markets and the population’s behavior. Whenever the financial markets become extremely active, whether in transaction volume or price, this causes the government to worry. The worry is that many small investors will lose money, and in turn will blame the government for the lack of proper market regulation. This is especially the case with companies in the peer-­to-­peer (P2P) business that <span aria-label="206" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" role="doc-pagebreak"/>issue high-­interest-­bearing bonds to investors and then lend out at even higher interest rates to individuals, usually for a short period of time. Oftentimes, when P2P companies default on their loans, hundreds or thousands of small investors gather outside government buildings demanding government action and compensation. Anticipating this, the Chinese government began issuing stern orders to strictly regulate the P2P business around 2019. In this example, the government behaves like a parent guarding the safety of a child learning how to drive a car, and the population is like a child needing support in case of an accident. In the United States, this type of structure is unimaginable—­investors should bear their own risks and consequences of investment failures.</p>

  <p class="text">Perhaps the best example to illustrate the behavior of an all-­responsible government is the COVID-­19 pandemic. The Chinese government’s response at the very beginning of the outbreak, around late November, was to prevent panic in society. To accomplish this, the Chinese Center for Disease Control performed its initial research while barring non-­CDC doctors from releasing any news about the emerging virus. Dr. Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, propagated the news using his personal social media account in late December, and was later called to the local police station to plead guilty to his misdemeanor and publicly apologize on local TV. This doctor was later hailed by the general public as a whistleblower. Technically speaking, he violated a rule that all well-­designed public health systems follow. That is, only qualified professionals in the disease control system are authorized to issue any news about a potential epidemic. However, in this case, he turned out to be right. Later on, by January 20, 2020, the Chinese government had determined that COVID-­19 was a new and infectious virus, leading them to shut down Wuhan, a city of twenty million people. The entire nation was also put on a high level of crisis alert. Many scholars in China argue that the government was too slow early on, but too harsh later on. Here, a <span aria-label="207" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207" role="doc-pagebreak"/>very simple explanation for the behavior of the Chinese government is that it tries to be all-­responsible: The citizens are treated like children, while the government acts as a parent, trying to do everything to protect the children.</p>

  <p class="text">Almost the opposite occurred in the US case, where the federal government and many states issued orders asking people to practice social distancing and wear masks. Many people took to the streets to protest openly and emotionally about these rules. Their attitude was: We are responsible for our own lives, and we will never accept any order from the government on such issues.</p>

  <p class="text">My goal is not to evaluate whether the Chinese or US government performed better in dealing with the COVID-­19 pandemic. Rather, the point here is that the two countries’ pandemic strategies represent two drastically different models of government-­citizen relations.</p>

  <p class="text">It is interesting to compare the mainstream libertarian belief with that of an all-­responsible government. The libertarians of course find the idea of an all-­responsible government repulsive. The libertarian belief is: “We the people are the bosses, and we delegate CERTAIN tasks to the government, in the process transferring SOME of our rights to the government. But if the government fails to deliver, we change the government.” The belief of an all-­responsible government is: “The people delegate MANY if not all rights to us in order for us to serve MANY if not all interests of the people.” Matching this belief, in China, due to two thousand years of tradition, most of the population expects and counts on the government to take care of many issues and would be willing to delegate their rights. Furthermore, in the Chinese case, the ruling party is deeply worried that it will be driven out just like the last emperor in 1911 and the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-­shek in 1949 if the party cannot live up to the high expectations of the population. For the time being, under President Xi Jinping, the political pendulum seems to have swung toward more government responsibility, as the government has become more <span aria-label="208" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ambitious in tackling many social problems, including inequality and environmental protection.</p>

  <p class="text">At the risk of oversimplifying, a typical government in the West is a quick carwash: The driver stays in the car, the washer only cleans the outside of the car. An all-­responsible government is like a thorough detailing of the car: Give us the key, trust us, and we come back with a complete job of cleaning.</p>

  <p class="text">The second feature of the Chinese model concerns the internal discipline of the dominant party. China is not alone in having a dominant party that has been the ruling party. Singapore has one. So did Japan and Mexico. And one of the most popular and relevant criticisms of such political practices asks: How can a one-­party system truly discipline itself? The argument is that in the United States and other democracies, parties compete against each other, and the party in power is watched carefully by the other parties. In addition, Western countries have legal systems that are intended to be independent of the government, allowing for further government discipline. In China, however, much emphasis is placed on internal discipline within the government and the ruling party.</p>

  <p class="text">In China, the State Supervisory Commission is in charge of internal discipline in the government and the Communist Party. The Commission conducts routine screenings of all government agencies. Also, when a government official or employee is suspected of work-­related misconduct, they are first investigated by the Commission and then sent to the legal system for trial if found to have violated the law. That is, in addition to the legal system, the Commission is an extra layer of discipline overseeing the government and the party. It is like an amplified version of the compliance department of a large corporation.</p>

  <p class="text">The Supervisory Commission is an extension of the tradition of two thousand years of Chinese bureaucracy. In Chinese history, a local official was also the head of the local court implementing the laws of the emperor. Who could discipline the official? <span aria-label="209" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The answer is an independent supervisory organization. Different dynasties had different names for this supervisory organization, but in each case, they functioned more or less the same way.</p>

  <p class="text">Wang Qishan was in charge of the party’s anticorruption activities between 2012 and 2017, and was instrumental in strengthening the system of the Supervisory Commission. On one occasion, he invited American scholar Francis Fukuyama to visit China and discuss politics. During Fukuyama’s visit, it was believed that Wang Qishan told him:</p>

  <p class="extract">I know all the theories and practices in the West regarding the rule of law and the necessity of the independence of the legal system, but in China, the independence of the legal system is not enough. Since we have a ruling party always in power, we need an additional system of internal discipline. We have such a tradition in Chinese history, while in the West, you do not.</p>

  <p class="text">The third feature of Chinese governance is respect-­centered diplomacy. That is, the fundamental principle of China’s diplomacy is to gain and maintain international respect for China, the people, the Party, and the government. Respect is even more impor­tant than real interests. This concept is a modern descendant of thousands of years of historical tradition, when the Imperial Chinese tributary system communicated to the countries of the region: We do not seek to obtain territory or economic interests and we do not seek to rule your country, but each year, send a delegate to us to show your respect for us as a large country and we will send our missions and gifts to reciprocate. This was a well-­established practice in Chinese history, partly because Chinese emperors knew that their domestic affairs were already too burdensome for them to take on affairs in other lands.</p>

  <p class="text">I would argue that respect-­centered diplomacy can explain most aspects of Chinese diplomacy. For example, the Belt and <span aria-label="210" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Road Initiative—­which is a program to build infrastructure projects and industrial parks in countries from China all the way to Africa—­is not necessarily commercially profitable, but has great potential to garner respect from the leaders of relevant countries. Similarly, the two most contentious issues between China and Japan are the disputed sovereignty of the small rock-­islands known as the Diaoyu Islands (or Senkaku Islands in Japanese) and the occasional visit of the Japanese prime minister to the Yasukuni Shrine, where some Japanese World War II generals who were convicted as war criminals are buried. Both issues are fundamentally tied to the issue of respect. In contrast, the Chinese government has long rejected Japanese offers for war compensation.</p>

  <p class="text">In another example, the actions of China in the South China Sea can also be understood this way. The Chinese government inherited claims of sovereignty on some of the islands in the South China Sea from the Nationalist government, and for many years, the Chinese approach has been to ask involved countries to recognize the disputed sovereignty claims while negotiating a way to share the benefits of economic development in the region, such as oil drilling. The key here is to earn respect from relevant countries in the region. Former president Duterte of the Philippines demonstrated a deep understanding of Chinese thinking in his policy decisions regarding the South China Sea. He was keen to show respect for China as a country and Chinese standing in the region without necessarily agreeing to Chinese sovereignty of the involved islands. In this way, he has been able to negotiate substantial economic deals between the Philippines and China.</p>

  <p class="text">Why is respect so impor­tant for Chinese diplomacy? First, it is a result of historical tradition. As Dr. Kissinger wrote in his book <span class="italic">On China</span>, China has thousands of years of tradition as a large, unified country, and for all this time it has been content with the idea of acting as the “middle kingdom” and requesting respect from other countries while not seeking to conquer them <span aria-label="211" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or interfere in their affairs. Accentuating this historical need for respect is the fact that over the past 160 years, China has suffered a gross lack of respect from Western powers. To make things even worse, today’s China—­despite being economically prosperous, technologically progressive, and militarily strong—­is perceived in the eyes of many Western politicians as an alien and unfriendly power due to what they believe is its lack of institutions of liberal democracy and multiparty politics.</p>

  <p class="text">Looking through this lens, arguably the biggest mistake that President Trump made in dealing with China was not in his actual policy. Instead, it was his lack of respect for China as a country and for the Communist Party as the ruling party. Trump referred to China as an opportunist country taking advantage of the United States, and he dished out sudden and harsh policies against China without any warning or private exchanges with Chinese leaders. In an interview with CNBC, I said that it was not the actual demands placed on China by the Trump administration that irritated Chinese decision makers, but rather the barking dog approach toward China that caused the biggest rift between the two countries. When dealing with China, a polite negotiation style is just as impor­tant as what you ask for from the negotiation. In the United States, it may be more common to have tough and red-­faced negotiations before reaching a deal and going out for a drink. In China, however, overly aggressive negotiation tactics can cause deals to collapse and leave both parties feeling bad.</p>

  <p class="text">Fortunately, perhaps the only thing President Trump got right in dealing with China was that he had always been polite with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Thus, China reciprocated by being polite with President Trump. Whenever I published an article about the United States in official Chinese media, I was always reminded to save face with President Trump and never mention his name when criticizing the US government. Personal attacks on President Trump are not allowed in Chinese official media.</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="212" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The Belt and Road Initiative</span> (BRI) is a program for Chinese private and state enterprises to help build infrastructure and industrial parks in the silk road countries and the marine silk road countries. These countries stretch from China all the way to Europe and Africa. Many Western observers worry that this is a form of Chinese neocolonialism, but this is not true. First, colonialism of any form requires political control or influence and China does not intend to have them. In fact, inside China, each year, there are reports that a Chinese BRI project has suffered from a major loss because the host country has had a change of government and the new government has turned unfriendly to China. And there are many studies in China about how to evaluate such political risks. That is, China does not have any prowess to influence let alone control these countries. The best examples are Kazakhstan and Ethiopia. Both countries went through regime changes around 2021 with China watching from far away.</p>

  <p class="text">The key motivation of the BRI is for China to gain international respect through its economic capacity. In many internal discussions, Xi Jinping emphasized that mutual respect and friendship are the top priorities rather than pure economic interest. Given this principle, China will work out the issue of excessive debt with relevant countries. Unlike debt taken on by poor countries for everyday consumption, the BRI debt has been incurred in order to build infrastructure. Arguably, the host countries are in a good position: They got the hardware in use while the debt was being postponed.</p>

  <p class="text">In contrast with the perceptions and worries of many Western observers, China is not in a position to export its approach to modern governance to other countries. In this regard, China does not aim to spread any ideology and is not like the former Soviet Union, which wove a network of Communist regimes. China is also vastly different from the United States and its Western allies, <span aria-label="213" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213" role="doc-pagebreak"/>which have historically had an agenda to promote liberal democracy and the policy framework that comes along with it.</p>

  <p class="text">A few examples help illustrate how China is not interested in spreading any ideology or model of sociopolitical governance. First, the case of South Africa. The late Nelson Mandela used to claim to be a follower of Mao, and his African National Congress was very close to the Chinese Communist Party. The ANC even sent some of its senior cadres to the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party Schools to study. However, China never held any conferences or sent any delegates or advisors to South Africa to instruct the ANC on how to conduct its policies. Second, the case of North Korea. One may think that because China is a strong supporter of North Korea, it must have advisors residing in North Korea, or the North Korean government and ruling party must constantly send delegates to report to or seek guidance from China. In reality, almost the opposite is true. North Korea often makes decisions before informing China, if at all. China has constantly suggested that North Korea should be more flexible in its policies and implement reforms. Such polite suggestions have often been met with criticisms that China has betrayed the principles of communism. Third, the case of Russia, which is an even more interesting example. Obviously, China and Russia have become close allies in recent years, and they cooperate on many international issues, often going against the viewpoints of the West. However, China has little interest in persuading Russia to follow any specific policies or ideas of political governance. Ideologically, China and Russia are far apart. In November 2017, China celebrated the centennial of the Russian Revolution, which has been credited as having brought Marxism to China. However, Putin’s Russia has been trying to distance itself from the Russian Revolution as much as possible. I happened to be a tourist in the summer of 2017 in St. Petersburg and visited the battleship <span class="italic">Aurora</span>, from which the first gunshot of the Russian Revolution was fired. To my surprise, there were more Chinese tourists than Russians <span aria-label="214" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214" role="doc-pagebreak"/>there! In fact, President Putin requested that the history books be rewritten to denounce the Russian Revolution. In this anecdote, you can see that ideologically, China and Russia are completely different, and China has no intention of challenging the Russian authorities on this matter.</p>

  <p class="text">Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, China has been put under an uncomfortable spotlight. Days before the crisis, China’s top leader promised to his Russian counterpart a good and unconditional relationship. It was clear that the Chinese leader did not have proper intelligence on what would happen. After the initial invasion, China switched to a neutral position: not supporting Russia in the United Nations, not joining the West in sanctioning Russia, not providing military support for either side, but maintaining economic transactions with Russia and Ukraine. More impor­tant, China has tried to push both sides to peace talks.</p>

  <p class="text">Why doesn’t China export its approach to modern governance? The most impor­tant reason is that senior Chinese government officials know too well that the Chinese political system is extremely difficult to duplicate outside of China. Why? Because today’s Chinese approach to sociopolitical governance is embedded in a tradition over one thousand years old, involving an extremely elaborate civil service system, and this system is almost impossible to transfer to other countries. The civil service system started with highly competitive nationwide exams to select government officials. The winners of the exams would be placed as government officials away from their hometowns to avoid nepotism and would be given the opportunity to gradually climb the ladder of the government hierarchy, gaining valuable experience along the way. In this way, any studious, determined, and lucky individual, no matter how humble their origins, could climb the ranks as high as the position of prime minister. As you can see, China historically has had a centralized and hierarchical civil service system. In the minds of many educated elites in China, <span aria-label="215" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the idea of maintaining social order with a well-­educated and merit-­based civil servant system is the social ideal. The kind of democracy practiced in India and the Philippines is not widely appreciated among Chinese elites. Despite India’s claims that it enjoys noisy harmony in a diversified society, many Chinese elites perceive the Indian case as chaotic, dangerous, and lacking basic law and order.</p>

  <p class="text">In numerous surveys about the future career aspirations of Chinese primary school students, “government official” is one of the top choices. The tremendous investment by the government and families in education and the widespread desire to enter public service separates China from other developing countries. Outside of Japan, Korea, and Singapore, very few countries feature this tradition and culture. This is why it is extremely difficult for low-­income countries without a preexisting strong foundation in civil service to duplicate the Chinese model. Professor Dwight Perkins of Harvard University started his career studying Chinese economic history and development and later studied economic development in Southeast Asia and Africa. He often commented in his class that if the Chinese system were to be transplanted to a low-­income country in Africa or even to Southeast Asia, it would be disastrous, because few places in the world have a civil service infrastructure that could support the Chinese system.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason that China does not export its approach to modern governance is very practical. That is, Chinese leaders are too busy with domestic affairs. The Chinese approach to modern governance is a top-­down approach with much power concentrated at the top. This means that top decision makers are extremely busy dealing with domestic issues and crises. Almost every week, there are urgent domestic problems, and China’s top leaders have to issue orders. The first half of the thirty-­minute, national 7:00 p.m. evening news is occupied by reports on the busy activities of national leaders in dealing with many issues, mostly domestic and often provincial issues. In contrast, the US <span aria-label="216" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216" role="doc-pagebreak"/>president does not have to deal with as many domestic issues. Governors and mayors are locally elected, and thus have the authority and autonomy to act in regional and local affairs. In academic language, the Chinese approach to governance has decreasing returns to scale; the larger the scale, the lower the efficiency. When applied to a city-­state like Singapore, this system works well. For a huge nation like China, though, this approach is exhausting for the top leaders.</p>

  <p class="text">Some analysts in the West may argue that even if China is not positioned to export its political philosophy and practice, China has set an example of non-­Western governance for the other governments to adopt. This view has ignored a simple fact that it is fundamentally an issue of domestic politics that decides whether a foreign government emulates anything from China. In such countries, a divide of pro-­China and anti-­China may arise, and, as respect-­centered diplomacy implies, it is very unlikely for the Chinese government to step in to interfere. China will most likely be very passive and noninterfering.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Many Westerners are very </span>concerned that China will export its social surveillance technology to other countries. First, China does have highly sophisticated surveillance technologies and they have been effectively deployed for law enforcement. A high-­profile and horrible case involved a super-­intelligent student at Peking University who killed his mother with a hammer and treated and stored her body very carefully in her room. He used her phone to text with her relatives and borrowed money from them. He claimed to have left China. Two years later, he finally was caught because he went to a Chinese airport to say good-­bye to his friend. A few seconds’ walk outside the car did him in. Without the camera at the airport, he could have been at large for many years or even forever.</p>

  <p class="text">A much less dramatic example is that my son always leaves <span aria-label="217" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" role="doc-pagebreak"/>his laptop, iPad, and headphone in a university’s library desk and comes out running errands for hours. I often suggest that he take care of his belongings, but they have never been stolen. He replies that theft is not an issue in libraries or classrooms, since there are cameras around. In general, a lot of crimes are solved or prevented with the assistance of the surveillance cameras.</p>

  <p class="text">Second, how intrusive are these surveillance technologies to ordinary people? Most Chinese I talked with feel comfortable and perceive that the technologies are their safeguards. Meanwhile, exchange students from Western countries seem to be visibly concerned when finding the cameras. I think the answer is that in general, for more ordinary people in China, the worry that government abuses the technologies is limited. I as a motorcycle rider should be worried about the omnipresent traffic cameras since there are many roads in Beijing banning motorcycle traffic. We motorcyclists have argued for years to change the restrictions. I often violate these rules, thinking that they are bad rules, but I am willing to pay the fine once I am caught by the camera. I have indeed gotten only some tickets. The police seem to be moderate, not going after all violations. The cameras are mostly meant for investigating major crimes and accidents.</p>

  <p class="text">Finally and most impor­tant, will China export the surveillance technologies? Such technologies are socially neutral and can be used to solve crimes or to prevent abusive behavior by the police. Fundamentally, it is up to the integrity of the importing government. At the US Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021, had there been a better surveillance system, law enforcement would have better means to find the offenders. China is not in a position to judge the qualifications of the buying government and then decide, on that basis, whether to export surveillance systems to them. In contrast, the United States sells billions of weapons to many countries. Weapons are only for wars, not to solve domestic crimes. In comparison with exporting weapons, selling surveillance technologies is a neutral act.</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="218" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Even though China is </span>not positioned to export its approach to sociopolitical governance, China and the West will certainly continue to have a growing mutual influence on one another in sociopolitical governance. So far, such influence has mostly been one way, that is, from the West to China. Eventually, it will be a two-­way exchange. I am confident that the West—­including the United States, which has historically been very confident and proud of its model of governance—­will pick up something meaningful from China.</p>

  <p class="text">It has long been the case that China is learning from the West. At my university, the joke is that before the era of reform and opening up, whenever we would try to convince our president to agree to do something, we would say, “Karl Marx said this. . . .” During the reform and opening up, we said, “Harvard or MIT does this. . . .” China is learning and will continue to learn a key ingredient of success from the United States: Decentralize and delegate decision-­making rights to individuals or private entities as much as possible, because once given sufficient liberty, they can accomplish amazingly creative feats. That is the lesson behind the success of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.</p>

  <p class="text">Now the reverse learning has begun in subtle ways. One example of this is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a leading university in science and technology in the United States. MIT’s business school, the Sloan School of Management, has been partners with Tsinghua’s School of Economics and Management, and for many years now has picked up many new ideas from Tsinghua. Starting around 2008, professors at the Sloan School began to push their deans for faster decision making, especially with regard to building a new office building. Their best argument: “Tsinghua did this and that, why can’t we do the same?” The whole university has had the same urge. Around 2018, MIT’s university board held its board meeting outside the United States for the first time. They came to a hotel near Tsinghua and as one <span aria-label="219" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" role="doc-pagebreak"/>item on the agenda, they had lunch with Tsinghua presidents and professors. I was there. The board members were curious about many aspects of Tsinghua’s operations.</p>

  <p class="text">What are the areas in which the West will most likely learn from China? There might be a few areas, but I would argue that the most impor­tant lesson by far is how to create a greater capacity for independent government agencies to carry out long-­term socioeconomic programs. In the United States, for instance, every two and six years there are congressional elections, and every four or eight years there is a change in the presidency. Due to these features of the US government, it is very difficult to make and stick to a well-­debated long-­term economic program. One solution is to establish or strengthen agencies that are independent of partisan politics, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Federal Communications Commission. China maintains continuity; the same party stays in power, and usually every ten years we see a major change in the national leadership. Meaningful socioeconomic programs are deliberated, decided on, and implemented, such as programs for environmental protection, high-­speed railroads, and scientific research.</p>

  <p class="text">Perhaps the trickiest lesson that the West may eventually learn from China is to be more flexible and open-­minded when it comes to sociopolitical governance. The West has long taken pride in its liberal political system. However, there are many answers to the question of how a country can be effectively governed under the general principle that human rights are respected. Each country is different, with its own culture and history, and as such, various forms of government can be suitable depending on the scenario. Eventually, the rise of China will in effect remind many people in the world to be more open-­minded and more understanding of other countries’ history, culture, politics, and institutions<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4">.</span></p>

  <p class="text">In summary, although it is too early to claim that China has established a Chinese model of sociopolitical governance, there are already prominent features of Chinese governance, namely, <span aria-label="220" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" role="doc-pagebreak"/>all-­responsible government, internal discipline of a dominant party, and respect-­centered diplomacy. What do these three features imply for China’s world view? That is, what is the thinking behind China’s domestic and international policies? The next chapter will explore China’s world view.</p>
