  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="initial-cap"><span class="dropcap">C</span></span>hina’s environmental protection, including decarbonization, is a rare social issue uniting all three communities: the Chinese population, the Chinese government, and the international community. This is the case primarily because as China becomes richer, the population is increasingly more concerned about the environment. Moreover, the Chinese top leadership has identified environmental protection as a top priority not only to gain popularity with the local population, but to showcase its capacity of good governance to the world, since China’s centralized governance system gives it the ability to be particularly effective on this issue. Finally, I explain that planting trees, pushing for investment in green technology, and phasing out polluting factories are the major means by which China is seeking to improve the environment and reduce carbon emissions. At the current pace, China is likely to become a world leader in improving environmental quality and fighting climate change.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line">There is no doubt </span>that the environment, especially air quality, has become an increasingly impor­tant social issue in China. Around 2016, I saw a TV interview in which people were asked how much money they would be willing to pay for significantly improved air quality. The median reply was 10,000 RMB (1,300 USD), about two months of an average salary of a white <span aria-label="161" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161" role="doc-pagebreak"/>collar worker. In fact, some elites even choose to emigrate out of China for better air quality, literally becoming refugees of pollution. I have a senior colleague at my university who decided to have his son emigrate to Canada because of Beijing’s air pollution, as his son had developed asthma. The boy’s mother gave up her much-­coveted job as a senior official in the Beijing municipal government to emigrate with her son to Canada.</p>

  <p class="text">Why have environmental issues become so impor­tant in China? One fundamental reason is that the Chinese population is becoming wealthier and enjoying a much longer life expectancy, now exceeding seventy-­eight years, slightly higher than that of the United States. When people are economically better off and live longer, they devote their time and energy to quality-­of-­life issues. Pollution has therefore become a much greater concern among the population than it was even five years ago.</p>

  <p class="text">A second reason for the ascendence of China’s environmental issues is international. That is, China as a nation is now attracting international attention and has become very globalized, especially cities like Beijing and Shanghai, to which increasing numbers of foreign students and visitors are coming and even settling. China’s rapid development has propelled cities like Beijing and Shanghai onto the same global stage as London, Paris, and New York. As a result of this increased visibility, pollution in Chinese cities has become more of an international issue. When I was working on establishing the Schwarzman College at Tsinghua University around 2012–­2017, I received many inquiries from applicants and later the parents of admitted Schwarzman scholars. They were intimidated by the fabled poor air quality of Beijing. To address their concerns, the whole College building was equipped with the most elaborate air cleaning system so that 24/7, students could enjoy air quality as good as that in any US city on the east coast. The cost of such a system comes not only from the initial equipment and the electricity consumed by the air pumps. In fact, the highest cost comes from the replacement of the air filters, which <span aria-label="162" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162" role="doc-pagebreak"/>costs as much as it would to hire a dozen staff members for the College! The super high air quality of the Schwarzman College has become a local political issue. Many local Chinese citizens have attacked us for spoiling the foreign students and generating inequality among the students on campus. We have had to keep a very low profile on this issue and tend to guard this as a top secret of the College.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line">Since he became China’s </span>leader in 2012, Xi Jinping has elevated environmental protection to one of the five major areas for national progress. He has popularized his idea of environmental protection in a “two mountain” metaphor. The Chinese government’s top five priority areas for national progress are politics, economic development, social welfare, cultural affairs, and environmental protection. Xi’s “two mountain” metaphor goes like this: A mountain made of gold or silver is valuable, but a green mountain with clear rivers is more precious. The underlying meaning is that economic development policies must also make room for environmental protection and recovery.</p>

  <p class="text">One likely intention behind Xi’s focus on environmental protection is to demonstrate that China can outperform both the developed West and democracies in emerging market countries like India in this regard, therefore showing that Chinese sociopolitical institutions can compete with, or even surpass, those of many democracies. President Xi has already earned a respectable international reputation, especially considering the context of the United States’ retreat from the Paris Agreement on climate change under President Trump. As the United States took a backseat on climate issues, China stepped up and is positioned to work closely with Europe to develop environmental policies and solutions. China’s commitments to global climate efforts grew even further in September 2020 and December 2020, when Chinese president Xi made a surprising pledge to peak China’s carbon emissions by <span aria-label="163" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" role="doc-pagebreak"/>2030 and make the country carbon neutral by 2060. I was told by Chinese experts that these goals were the most ambitious ones deliberated among all the alternative options. This shows that the Chinese top leadership has been very aggressive on the issue of global warming.</p>

  <p class="text">As a matter of fact, Chinese sociopolitical institutions are indeed well positioned to implement initiatives on environmental protection and climate change. This is because most projects in environmental protection and recovery require coordination and collective action, such as relocating factories and enacting policies that may sacrifice short-­term profits. Such efforts also require the adoption of new technologies. Fortunately, these two areas are the forte of Chinese institutions.</p>

  <p class="text">Broadly speaking, there are three simultaneous approaches for China to achieve its goals in environmental protection and carbon reduction. The first approach is oftentimes very challenging. That is, to phase out or wipe out polluting production facilities. For example, in the western section of Beijing, where the wind blows to the east in the winter, there was once a huge industrial complex called Capital Steel, which produced steel using coal and iron ore extracted not far from the plant. When I was in college, I spent one month as an intern working at Capital Steel. I still remember the horrible scene of crimson-­colored water running through the factory, serving as a coolant. And then there was the sight of smoke billowing out from the chimneys—­all of this at a factory only fifteen kilometers away from Tiananmen Square, the center of Beijing! In 2007, one year before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the municipal government finally moved that factory to a new site in the province of Hebei, 250 kilometers from Beijing, near the oceanfront. It now uses modern technology, such as multiple cycles of water treatment, dust control, and recycling the heat produced as energy, trapping the emissions of sulfur dioxide. This was not an easy process, and required the relocation of more than 150,000 employees. More recently, the old Capital Steel <span aria-label="164" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164" role="doc-pagebreak"/>compound was renovated and repurposed as the planning headquarters for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. It also hosted a number of Olympic events, with the big air snowboard ramp artfully placed among the factory’s former smokestacks—­a powerful symbol of urban regeneration.</p>

  <p class="text">China’s drive to close polluting production facilities has caused economic pains in many provinces, especially those such as Hebei, Jiangsu, and Shandong, which are strongholds of heavy industry. I am often invited to give talks to business executives and government officials in these regions, and one of their biggest complaints has been the mounting pressure to either clean up or shut down. For example, I know the founder of one of the biggest phosphorus firms in China. His company supplies ingredients to products like Coca-­Cola and toothpaste, and is based in Jiangsu province, the richest province in China. This executive had to shut down a brand-­new factory because he did not obtain complete environmental approval before investment. Even though he told me that his factory was completely compatible with all relevant regulations, nobody could save him. In the end, his company had to default on its bank loans, causing a huge loss for many of his friends, who had guaranteed the loans. Environmental protection has become a must-­do issue!</p>

  <p class="text">The second approach to improving environmental quality is to push for the adoption of green technologies at a swift pace. As a result of this rapid investment in green technology, cleaning up China’s pollution may actually become a major engine for generating future economic growth. This is facilitated by the fact that China has a high-­savings economy and the supply for capital investment is abundant. Once, I met a director-­general of the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information, and I was told that they are encouraging the rapid adoption of ten common green technologies for industries. One example is energy-­efficient water boilers. Water boilers are widely used in manufacturing firms to generate hot water and steam, and their energy efficiency is very <span aria-label="165" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165" role="doc-pagebreak"/>impor­tant. All over China, there is also an ongoing effort to phase out coal-­fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. By 2022, China had become the world’s leading producer of solar panels and wind turbines by far. The cost of solar power is moving downward very quickly, such that it has become cheaper than coal-­fired power by 2023. The greatest challenge is storing solar energy for use in the evening, after the sun has set. To address this issue, a senior engineer of China’s State Grid, the company that owns China’s electricity network, showed me that they are developing low-­cost and maintenance-­free batteries as large as cargo containers, which will be deployed in deserts next to the solar panels.</p>

  <p class="text">Another example of environmental improvement technology is extra high voltage transmission, which raises the voltage from five hundred thousand to one million volts so that power can be transmitted over two thousand kilometers without much loss. This is impor­tant because most of China’s energy is used in the eastern coastal areas, whereas a large amount of renewable energy, including wind and solar, is produced in western China. With this extra high voltage technology, 50 percent of the power generated in southwestern China near Vietnam—­where hydro energy is mostly used—­can be delivered to the province of Guangdong. In this way, Guangdong, which is an industrial stronghold, is able to greatly reduce its consumption of coal. As of 2017, there were many discussions in China regarding building an energy internet between China and its neighboring countries. The idea is to connect the countries with an extra high voltage power grid in order for countries to share energy and balance gaps in demand and supply across countries.</p>

  <p class="text">Automobiles and gasoline are yet another area exemplifying the rapid adoption of green technology. The current standard for the cleanliness of gasoline supplied in Beijing is as high as most US standards. Moreover, the Beijing government is aggressive in forcing old cars to stay off the road. My family bought a seven-­seat <span aria-label="166" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166" role="doc-pagebreak"/>minivan in 2005, and the car was still in excellent condition in 2017, with only thirty-­two thousand kilometers on the odometer. However, starting in 2017, I could no longer drive it on weekdays because it was deemed too old. Furthermore, it had to be inspected every year to stay on the road at all. If I scrapped the car according to government policy, I would receive the equivalent of 700 US dollars in subsidies, intended to eliminate highly polluting cars from the road. Such government measures regarding automobiles do not make economic sense, because the main source of pollution in Beijing is clearly the surrounding iron, steel, and cement industries. In the city of Tangshan, two hundred kilometers from Beijing, row after row of steel plant chimneys can be seen. About 30 percent of China’s steel production and nearly 50 percent of coke production (the process that creates the greatest amount of pollution) are concentrated near Beijing. Instead of spending money on programs like encouraging the scrapping of “old” cars, the Beijing Municipal Government should provide funds to Hebei province to reduce pollution. There is a calculation that for every Yuan spent on reducing pollution in Hebei, the impact is twice as great as when the money is spent in Beijing.</p>

  <p class="text">Electric vehicles have been heavily promoted, and starting in 2022 China accounted for over one-­half of the world’s production and sales of EVs. In the city of Beijing, drivers must enter an incredibly competitive lottery to obtain a valid license plate, and they have a much higher chance of winning if they have a purely electric car as opposed to a conventional one. In addition, each traditional energy car is prohibited from being driven one day per week, depending on the last number of the license plate, while a pure electric car can always be used. In the city of Shanghai, the license plate for a plug-­in hybrid or purely electrical car is free, while that for a conventional car costs about 12,000 USD. It’s no wonder that in 2020, Chinese electric car producer NIO became the third largest car company in stock market value, following Tesla and Toyota. Its share price shot up by 1,000 times in 2020<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4">.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="167" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The third approach to improving the environment is simple: Plant trees and guard with extreme diligence against forest fires. Each year in mid-­March, China has a national Tree Planting Day, demonstrating the country’s commitment to maintaining green spaces, even in urban areas. As the world’s biggest tree planter, China is one of the very few large countries to have significantly improved its forest coverage, from 14 percent to 23 percent between 1977 and 2019. For example, Beijing is surrounded by six circular highways, or “ring roads,” that emanate outward from the center of the city. The 5th Ring Road is as long as ninety-­nine kilometers, and the Beijing municipal government has planted trees all along it at a width of one hundred meters of trees on the inside and two hundred meters on the outside. Along the 188-­km-­long 6th Ring Road, the tree regions are as wide as five hundred meters on the inside and one thousand meters on the outside. In recent years, many international experts have raised the issue of the need for diversity of the species of tree in China. To increase the variety of trees, more than thirty types of vegetation have been included in the case of Beijing.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line">China’s coordinated policy making </span>and rapid adoption of green technologies have allowed many of China’s major cities, such as Beijing, to make significant improvements in air quality over the past decade and a half. According to a study by the United Nations Environmental Protection Agency (UNEP), most airborne pollutants in China declined drastically between 1998 and 2013. Sulfur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5">2</span>) fell by 17 percent, nitrogen dioxide (NO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5">2</span>) fell by 24 percent, PM 10 (a measure of inhalable pollutants) fell by 43 percent, and carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5">2</span>) fell by 57 percent. In the case of Beijing, from 2015 to 2020, the measure of PM2.5, sulphur dioxide (SO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5">2</span>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5">2</span>), and PM10 <span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-5"> </span>declined by 52.9 percent, 70.4 percent, 42.0 percent and 44.8 percent, respectively. The most impor­tant contributions came from replacing coal with natural gas for winter heating and cleaning up polluting production facilities in <span aria-label="168" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168" role="doc-pagebreak"/>regions near Beijing.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter12.xhtml#footnote-006">7</a></span></span> By 2023, the issue of air quality in major Chinese cities has faded away from being the top internet topic.</p>

  <p class="text">In recent years, the Chinese central government has further tightened its policy on environmental protection, oftentimes against the preference of local government officials and private entrepreneurs who are more concerned about economic growth. Large cities are phasing out coal for winter heating, replaced by natural gas. There is a ten-­year fishing ban from 2020 to 2030 for the whole Yangtze River to allow the fish population to recoup. A number of mountain ranges, grasslands, and river areas, where the ecological systems are perceived to be very fragile, are singled out for protection from all economic investments. A few industries such as coal mining, iron and steel, nonferrous metal, and construction materials have also been given orders to cap their production, meaning that they may have to trade production permits among themselves. Such measures are economically forceful or even brutal but promise environmental benefits.</p>

  <p class="text _idGenParaOverride-1">Again, the environment in China is a rare happy story, in which the population breathes cleaner air, the top leadership gets credit, and the international community has its concerns partly addressed, even though more progress is still desired. In addition, as China has become one of the world’s top carbon emitters but also the world’s center of solar panels and windmill manufacturing, climate change will be one of the few areas on which China and the West collaborate closely. In comparison with the issue of pollution, the issue of population policy proves to be much more complex, as there is not as much consensus in this area. Next, I discuss the issue of Chinese population policy.</p>
