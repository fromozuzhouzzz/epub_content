  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">P</span>erhaps the biggest misperception that outsiders have about China is that Chinese media and the Chinese internet are wastelands of boring content, given that Facebook and Google are blocked in China. On the contrary, the Chinese internet ecosystem is a buzzing marketplace of 1.3 billion internet users exchanging ideas, creating content, and buying products. It is a universe of its own. Every day the Chinese internet gives rise to a number of new hot topics, viral videos, or slang terms. Even my ninety-­eight-­year-­old mother is glued to WeChat (a chat program, social media app, and payment platform all in one). Meanwhile, Douyin (the Chinese version of Tik Tok) is wildly popular for memes, exchanging ideas, and e-­commerce. Most of my friends have a habit of checking their mobile phones for news and WeChat posts every five minutes. People discuss everything on the Chinese internet, and some even sell their insights by putting their news, analysis, and courses up for purchase. Meanwhile, influencers broadcast at all hours of the day recommending products for sale. China’s top influencer (as inferred from a case of tax evasion) earns around 250 million USD a year, about twice that of the world’s best athletes like LeBron James or Messi.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter11.xhtml#footnote-005">6</a></span></span></p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="151" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In this chapter, I explain that the Chinese internet and media have two interesting features beyond the well-­known phenomenon of tight government control. That is, there is an onion structure to the internet and media, with the inner layers being much more open than the outside. Also, there are coded ways to express one’s opinions. After this, I explain that, given the mounting pressure for more openness, China’s internet and media will see significant reforms, with the effect of softening control.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There are three features </span>of the Chinese approach to news media and the internet, as well as freedom of speech in general. One of them is obvious, while the other two are less noticeable or even unknown. One needs to understand all of them in order to comprehend the whole picture and the underlying factors of the Chinese approach.</p>

  <p class="text">The first feature is rather obvious. That is, the Chinese news media and internet are under careful management. If you push an inappropriate post, it will be blacked out in a few minutes. If you want to send out an inappropriate picture or file through WeChat, your friend will not receive it. WeChat seems to have sophisticated programs to do this in order to fulfill the monumental task of ensuring users abide by government guidelines. Meanwhile, inappropriate foreign websites are not accessible from inside China. If you want to visit the website of Google or the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, you will either wait forever as the page perpetually loads, or you will receive a message saying that the link is broken. Some people have ways to get around this, for example, by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p>

  <p class="text">What contents on the internet are regarded as inappropriate? <span aria-label="152" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To begin with, personal attacks on individual political leaders are not appropriate, including jokes about their accent or appearance. In addition, comments and articles criticizing the political regime are prohibited. Interestingly, discussions that are clearly in favor of the Communist Party but stray from the officially accepted terminology are also blocked. For example, around 2016, one of my colleagues, Professor Daniel Bell, wrote an op-­ed in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, praising the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Party in recruiting and promoting good talents to join the party and the government. He said that the party will exist for a long time, but its name may change, dropping the word <span class="italic">communism</span>. As a Canadian professor teaching in China, he was treated with great respect, but the Chinese translation of this article was blocked.</p>

  <p class="text">The second feature of the Chinese media and internet is less known than the first. That is, China has an onion-­structured media market with the inner layers being more open than the outer layers, providing specific news and media services for China’s inner circle of decision makers. Senior Chinese officials are provided with a special news service called reference news. In the Mao era, a few volumes of reference news were compiled twice a day by a special branch of the Xinhua News Agency, with each volume about the size of a magazine. Such a tradition is still in practice. Only officials higher than a certain rank were allowed access to these reports, which covered not only international news, but also domestic events regarded as unfitting for the general public, such as severe damage from a natural disaster or a public demonstration in a local region. In addition to news, relevant commentary from key opinion makers was also featured in the reports. In the reform era, the same tradition has been kept, but with some added sophistication due to technological advancements. Each rank of officials has special information and opinion-­gathering services. In addition, highly educated individuals often buy VPN services, which allow them to read all of the news from <span aria-label="153" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the outside world. A VPN is a paid service account enabling users to bypass the Chinese “great firewall.” Although strictly speaking, VPN services are illegal in China, the risk of individual users being punished is close to zero so long as they do not actively use or publicize foreign news in Chinese social media. Why is there this seemingly hypocritical practice? The answer is that elites and decision makers in China need to be and are well informed on news and social opinions from around the world. As a result, it is incorrect to assume that top officials in China are deprived of true information.</p>

  <p class="text">The third feature is perhaps even more interesting than the second. That is, there are many ways to voice discontent, disagreement, or even clear criticism in the Chinese media and internet. There are articles, posts, and speeches in the media and on the internet, as well as in-­person meetings, which convey sharp criticisms in an indirect way. This may be called the coded speech of criticism, with the end result being that relevant government officials still receive the messages intended for them. It might be a surprise to people outside of China that higher-­level officials are usually willing to listen to sharp opinions and criticism in private. People used to joke that the most antigovernment and anti-­Communist Party views are voiced and discussed in the Central Party School, where senior officials periodically receive training. Many China hands outside China knew this, and they took pride in having been invited to give talks at the Central Party School, where central government officials are very much willing to listen to criticisms. As a non–­Communist Party scholar, I have been invited to give talks to officials on various occasions. Before my talks, the hosts often say: “We want to hear the truth; be bold, and open.” Why is this? The reason is very simple: These are like intra-­family talks; the audience knows that the intention of the speaker is not to undermine the regime, and they are hungry for information not conveyed in the official media, the outer layers of the onion<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4">.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="154" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The speech coded as a way to constructively criticize the government and its policies has over two thousand years of history in China and is still essential to all publications in today’s media and internet. In history, ministers of a court always first praise the emperor before making suggestions. Today, all published and uncensored materials in Chinese media and on the internet fall into two categories. The first is purely praising the government and policies. They usually do not carry much readership. The second category is constructive criticism or coded speech. For example, each quarter or half year, many economic research centers publish reports on the latest news about the Chinese economy. Such reports always start with positive aspects of the economy and give credit to relevant policies. Then, much more space is devoted to the aspects that can be improved and relevant policy proposals. The wording is always positive but it does not take an expert to understand the sharp criticisms. What is most interesting is that in China top leaders pay more attention to the second category of publication and often write comments on such articles. Their comments are treated as orders to take actions by lower-­level officials. Writing such comments is a major part of the work of a senior official. And being commented on by a senior official is a credit to the author of the original article and is a KPI (key performance indicator) for a think tank.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Why does the Chinese </span>government exercise careful control over the news media and internet? Some fundamental reasons for this delve deep into the political tradition of the Communist Party, while others can be traced through China’s two thousand years of political thinking. Both of these foundations for Chinese thinking on media and the internet now face daily challenges in a modern and fast-­paced Chinese society.</p>

  <p class="text">The Chinese Communist Party has a long tradition of carefully managing its messages to the general public, going back to <span aria-label="155" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak"/>its founding day in 1921. The party was established by a small number of scholars and students who absorbed the values of communism and endeavored to spread its message like evangelical believers. Of course, what motivated the young scholars and students was not just the ideals of Marxism, but also a deep concern for the decline of China as a nation. Later on, when the party faced its first monumental setback in the spring of 1927 as hundreds of party members were killed at the hands of the Nationalists, party leaders began to organize military uprisings and went to the countryside to establish military bases. The key idea was to spread the messages of the party in order to recruit believers to join the revolution.</p>

  <p class="text">Beginning in the fall of 1928, the Chinese Communist Party formed a two-­handed revolutionary strategy: one hand for holding rifles, and the other hand for holding pens—­that is, mass propaganda. Propaganda in today’s Western language has a very negative connotation, but in a time of war, it is absolutely critical. It was essential that the Red Army reach out to the population at a grassroots level for material support, such as recruiting soldiers, obtaining food and clothing, and scouting for intelligence. During the most difficult days of the Communist Party’s history, when the Red Army was forced to retreat from their home base, they still held on to their printing machines. The Red Army would go around and print pamphlets, passing them out to the peasants in the countryside to gain their support. As a revolutionary party, the Communist Party made propaganda its top priority a decade before realizing the importance of organizing its own military force. Mao Zedong said numerous times that mobilizing the masses was the key to winning the revolution, and the key to mobilizing the masses was conveying direct messages to them—­that is, propaganda.</p>

  <p class="text">To summarize, the importance of public relations is rooted deep in the tradition of China’s ruling party. Today, at each level of the government, one of the top five officials is solely responsible <span aria-label="156" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for news and media or publicity work in general. The Minister of the Department of Propaganda is regarded as one of the five most prominent figures in Communist Party committees at all levels. On a provincial or municipal level, the person in charge of propaganda is also one of the seven or nine standing committee members of the Communist Party branch.</p>

  <p class="text">As a result of its long revolutionary tradition, today’s Chinese government more or less continues to directly control the country’s news media organizations. All TV stations, as well as all official national and regional newspapers, such the <span class="italic">People’s Daily</span>, <span class="italic">Beijing Daily</span>, and <span class="italic">Sichuan Daily</span>, are under the control of the party’s Department of Publicity. Internet platforms such as sina.com and qq.com exist in a gray area. Officially, they do not have permission to conduct interviews or broadcast news. In reality, they do so with self-­constraint, avoiding the publication of news or comments that could potentially be politically irritating. The Chinese government issues direct guidelines and policies to such organizations, rather than by law having its effect through market forces.</p>

  <p class="text">In addition to its revolutionary tradition, there is also a fundamental philosophical tenet behind the Chinese government’s approach to news media and the internet—­that is, the all-­responsible thinking of Confucian political philosophy. According to this thinking, the government is like a parent, the general public is like children, and the parent must look out for the best interests of the children. Some news may cause widespread panic among the general public, while some comments and opinions may cause discomfort and anxiety. Thus, these sources of panic and distrust must be managed. This is obviously drastically different from the libertarian philosophy, which holds the belief that individuals are rational and individual freedom is of the highest value to society, and individuals should make judgments for themselves.</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="157" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Pressures are mounting on </span>the Chinese government to reform its management of media and the internet. The leading reason is very simple: China’s rising middle-­income population is demanding better access to information and more open expression of their opinions. As of 2020, China had as many as<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>four hundred million middle-­income citizens. By 2035, the number may go up to eight hundred million, larger than the sum of middle-­income inhabitants of Europe, Japan, and the United States. This sector of the Chinese population is full of people who are well educated and enjoy increasingly comfortable living. They often travel abroad as tourists and send their children to foreign countries for education. The next thing they desire is information on various issues and freedom of expression. This does not necessarily mean that they are unhappy with the government. In fact, according to many surveys, the majority of them are not willing to accept the major political instability that would accompany a change in China’s political structure.</p>

  <p class="text">In addition to the demand of the rising middle-­income population, Chinese top leadership knows very well that they have to rise to the challenge of the media and internet. Xi Jinping has said many times in very colloquial language: If we (the ruling party) cannot respond properly to the challenge of the internet, we will not be able to govern the country for long. By this, he means that the ruling party and the Chinese government must find ways to release the pressure simmering in the internet, and more impor­tant, to make sure that competing political forces will not undermine the regime by manipulating content in the internet and media.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason for the Chinese government to implement reforms of the media and internet is that with continued economic development and improvement in social management, Chinese leaders will become more confident and will be less afraid of domestic and international criticisms. Take for example <span aria-label="158" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the Chinese relative success in response to the global financial crisis of 2008, the Beijing Olympics of 2008, and the Beijing Winter Olympics of 2022. As confidence builds, government policies regarding the news media and internet will be gradually relaxed. This will be a very popular and welcome reform in China.</p>

  <p class="text">What are the possible reforms to the internet and media? Many believe that there are two dimensions. First, self-­governing mechanisms among internet companies, user groups, and media organizations. The keyword is decentralization. In many countries, hate speech, false claims, and extremist views are not eliminated by any central authority. Instead, news agencies and media companies have incentives to weed out such views. For example, I have noticed that in major media websites such as that of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, users leave comments after each article. If other readers find the comments to be hateful, they can choose to report the comment in question. When a posting receives a large number of complaints, the posting or the writer will be blocked. In China, such practices are being followed but will certainly be more widely implemented.</p>

  <p class="text">The second dimension of the reform is that the government will become much more proactive in making its own case in the media and internet, competing with other views rather than restricting the opinions of the netizens directly. That is, government agencies will lower their profile and speak equally and persuasively with the population rather than proclaiming commanding messages. There is already a clear trend of government agencies appointing a spokesperson to work with the media. It used to be that such spokespersons often fell victim to controversy and widespread criticism. For example, after a crash of a high-­speed train in July 2011, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Railways<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>(now the Chinese Railway Corporation) ran into big trouble with the general public. After providing his version of the cause of the accident, he said casually in a colloquial style: “Whatever you believe, I believe it.” His remarks immediately <span aria-label="159" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159" role="doc-pagebreak"/>drew widespread criticism on the internet as netizens joked about the tone of the speech. Nowadays, these kinds of nonprofessional government spokespersons are diminishing in number, as they have undergone rounds of training in schools of journalism in Chinese universities. I know of colleagues who specialize in such training and teach simple principles guiding government officials who face the media and internet. Some of the principles include: Be open and friendly, publicize only information that has already been verified, and when facing challenging questions, repeat what you know and never go beyond your key messages.</p>

  <p class="text">The media and internet are perhaps some of the most socially divisive topics everywhere in the world, and from the descriptions above, China does not seem to be an exception. The environment and carbon emissions are another worldwide hot topic, and on this subject, Chinese society overall has seen good progress and is much less divided than on other topics. We turn to such issues in the next chapter.</p>
