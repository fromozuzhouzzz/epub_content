  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_16"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter16"><span class="running-head">China’s World View</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this chapter, I illustrate a set of views regarding China and the world on<span class="CALLOUT"> </span>which many Chinese policy makers, business executives, and educated people concur, which I call China’s world view. Among the seven points of China’s world view, three stand out. First, China must take care of its domestic issues properly before working on international ones. Second, when dealing with foreign affairs, winning respect is the most impor­tant thing. Third, it is impor­tant to try to stay cooperative with the United States but stand firm on issues of core interest to China, that is, the issue of Taiwan and the ability for technological improvement.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">By world view, </span>I refer to a set of widely agreed upon general principles shared among the country’s top decision makers and the educated general public. In fact, no country has a single world view, and a country the size of China has a wide spectrum of views, depending on income, education, and exposure to other parts of the world. However, there are a short list of views that a country’s policy makers and educated population mostly share. For example, in the United States, most people would agree that individual liberty should be respected so long as it is not in conflict with social welfare, as in the case of a pandemic. In a country like China with a long history and strong culture, the list of world views is likely longer than in <span aria-label="222" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" role="doc-pagebreak"/>many countries, and most are like folk wisdom and are taken for granted.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">1. Governing China Is Like Students </span><span class="italic">Taking Exams</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Before entering the city of Beijing and assuming national power, Mao Zedong said: “We are like students going to take the civil servant exams given by the emperor in the court in the old days and we better stay on our toes and not fail them.” By this, he meant that if the Communist Party messes up in governing China and causes widespread discontent, the party will be ousted by other political forces just as the Nationalist Party was driven out by the Communists. More impor­tant, unlike what happens when a Republican or Democratic president is voted out, the whole political regime in China will be undermined, and there will be no chance to come back as in a national election. The exam mentality and ensuing anxiety have always been on the mind of the Communist Party. For example, Chinese top decision makers have always put the utmost priority on grain security and have always been very concerned about inflation, since food shortage and inflation are likely causes of widespread discontent or even open protest. The exam mentality explains the extreme caution or even paranoia of China’s policy makers. Whenever and whatever decisions they deliberate, the first and most impor­tant question is: Will this cause social instability? This is not well understood by many observers or analysts outside China, who believe that the Chinese government, with a large army and police force and tight control of many functions of society, should be very confident or even complacent. It is just the opposite. In an impor­tant sense, the exam mentality has kept Chinese policy makers always on their toes and rarely reckless. I sometimes call this the Chinese style of discipline on the government, instead of the conventional electoral democracy and separation of powers.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span aria-label="223" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="italic">2. </span><span class="italic">Home</span><span class="italic">work First</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Given that governing China is like students taking exams, homework is most impor­tant in preparation. And the most impor­tant homework is to manage Chinese domestic affairs well. I call this the finish-­homework-­before-­going-­to-­parties principle. When presidential candidate Donald Trump uttered his campaign motto “America First,” many people in China tended to relate this to the Chinese view of homework. By “homework” I mean working to solve domestic issues. By “going to parties” I mean working out matters related to the international arena. This is because most people in China feel that since China is a huge country with a large population, solving Chinese domestic problems inherently makes a tremendously positive contribution to the rest of the world. People in China often argue that if China were to fall into crisis—­be that due to economic distress, social unrest, or civil war—­this would place an enormous burden on the rest of the world. Any experienced political leader in the West recognizes this.</p>

  <p class="text">One example of this view was exhibited during the China-­US trade dispute, when President Trump did what previously had been unthinkable, such as labeling a Chinese company as a national threat to the United States and threatening to cut off its supply of computer chips. In China, this widely reinforced the belief that domestic issues should take priority, as dealing with President Trump proved to be essentially useless. The only sure way to resolve this kind of pressure from abroad will be to build domestic strength in technological innovation. In this way, it will be possible to avoid being at the mercy of foreign nations.</p>

  <p class="text">What are the major pieces of “homework” China must complete? First, to make sure the domestic economy is maintaining its momentum. It is clearly and widely understood that without stable economic growth and prosperity, everything is built on sand. <span aria-label="224" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Second, social stability has a firm foundation. That is, widespread social protests and grievances should be resolved at their roots. Most protests are not politically motivated and are not demanding freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or the formation of a competing party. Rather, mass protests in mainland China are concerned with mundane issues that affect people’s daily lives, such as water pollution, military veterans not getting proper pensions, and people getting cheated of their savings by fake investment schemes, etc. Third, there is continued improvement in education, science, and technology, as they concern the future of the country. And fourth, environmental protection is a major priority due to its increasing consequences for the sustainability and health of both China and the world.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">3. </span><span class="italic">Historical Conservatism</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Chinese foreign policies and even some domestic ones often originate from a philosophy that can be summarized as historical conservatism: Respect history and do not deviate from historical claims. The issue is: How far back does history go? For most practical policy matters, history starts with 1949, when the founders of the People’s Republic, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and their colleagues, set the principles. This explains the puzzle of why China is so persistent in regarding the claim that many small and seemingly insignificant islands in the South China Sea belong to China, while China was not going after Russia for the huge amount of land obtained by the tsars in the mid-­nineteenth century (the size of France and Germany combined). This also explains why China is persistent on the Taiwan issue and why China is keen to receive a proper apology from the Japanese emperor over the Japanese invasion of 1937–­1945 even though the United States has never received an official, unabashed apology from the Japanese, either. Meanwhile, the Chinese government rejected multiple offers from Japan in the 1970s and 1980s to provide economic compensation for the war damage, thinking <span aria-label="225" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that such compensation might be viewed as a substitute for official apologies. The simple answer is that Mao and Zhou set the tone in the first years of the founding of the People’s Republic.</p>

  <p class="text">The principle of historical conservatism also explains why China is not going after issues that had been settled by 1949. In Chinese textbooks, the Opium War of 1840–1842 with the ensuing unequal treaties was an evil act of the imperial powers. However, today’s Chinese government never asked the queen or king or the prime minister of the UK to apologize for this, unlike the case of the Japanese government. The answer is that the case of the Opium War and the ensuing unequal treaties were in general already settled by the Nationalist Government before 1949. Therefore, the Chinese government after 1949 has not gone after the UK on such issues. In contrast, the issue of whether a few islands near Taiwan belong to Taiwan had not been settled by 1949. Neither had the issue of whether Japan needs to apologize to or compensate China for the invasion.</p>

  <p class="text">Most of China’s current foreign policies can be understood from this perspective: The current Chinese government is not willing to deviate from previous policies established by Mao and Zhou Enlai. One exception is that many foreign policies during the Cultural Revolution are not followed, such as supporting revolutions and revolts in foreign countries, since the whole episode of the Cultural Revolution has been denounced.</p>

  <p class="text">Historical conservatism explains China’s foreign policy dilemma when dealing with North Korea. North Korea was a close ally under Mao and Zhou Enlai. In Chinese official language, the friendship with North Korea was “forged with blood” due to the Korean War. Today’s Chinese government is extremely reluctant to withdraw its support for North Korea despite the fact that North Korea’s policy of pursuing nuclear weapons clearly goes against China’s best interests, since this has provoked South Korea to station more US military facilities near the Chinese border.</p>

  <p class="text">This “historical conservatism” is in effect explained by the huge <span aria-label="226" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226" role="doc-pagebreak"/>contrast between China’s Communist Party concerning the legacy of Mao and that of the former Soviet Union concerning the legacy of Stalin. China’s Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping and now Xi Jinping readily recognized that Mao was a great hero, although he made mistakes in his later years in waging the Cultural Revolution; on the other hand, Stalin’s successor Khrushchev suddenly and completely condemned Stalin, which angered Mao and triggered him to wage the Cultural Revolution in order to prevent any “Khrushchevs” from coming to power after his death.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">4. “Respect </span><span class="italic">First” Diplomacy</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">China harbors a great desire to gain respect from the rest of the world, especially the West, and this is an area in which Westerners, especially Americans, may not understand or at least underestimate China’s convictions. Looking through this lens, people can more easily understand the actions of Chinese leaders. Take, for example, the Belt and Road initiative. In May 2017 and April 2019, President Xi Jinping hosted two huge international events called the Summit of the Belt and Road Collaboration. Thirty to forty heads of nations attended, a larger number than would attend a UN general assembly meeting. Every day for a week, the official Chinese TV news programs showed President Xi Jinping hosting red carpet receptions for these leaders, each of whom came to China to express their willingness to understand and work with China.</p>

  <p class="text">Some may view this as a display of vanity, but when I speak to ordinary citizens they feel a sense of pride that China has now become a nation that warrants this kind of respect. The Belt and Road Initiative is not only designed to gain economic benefits from working with these countries, but also to gain international respect. President Xi has often expressed a new theory of international collaboration, which is based on a balance between moral leadership and economic interests, therefore allowing China to gain more respect on the international stage.</p>

  <p class="text">How to deal with China is perhaps more impor­tant than what <span aria-label="227" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to ask from China. Again, the Belt and Road Initiative is a case in contrast. It is not totally clear whether China benefited economically in net from the BRI; however, China has obtained proper respect from the participants of the BRI. When provoked or insulted, the Chinese tend to become very nationalistic, and when treated with respect, they tend to be open to working together. Think of respect for China as a nation the same as economic and other interests to a Western country.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">5. Do Not Export the </span><span class="italic">Chinese Model</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">A majority or even overwhelming view in China among political leaders and scholars alike is that China should not export its political thinking or political system abroad, not only because it is unnecessary, but because it is also impossible. This has been a view that has been shared by Chinese leaders and most average Chinese people for the last decades. In 2012, when he was still the vice president of China, Xi Jinping complained to a group of reporters while visiting Mexico: “It is unfair for the West to criticize China. Over the past decades, China has not exported its ideology and political system to any other countries, China has not sought to overturn any foreign regime, and China has taken care of the welfare of its large population and has not exported poverty or refugees to the world. Why have we always been blamed and criticized? It is utterly unfair.”</p>

  <p class="text">Pakistan is another example in which China has no intention of exporting its ideology and political system. Pakistan is arguably China’s most stable friend as a neighbor, not just because of its common foe in India. In Chinese, there is an expression that Pakistan is as solid as steel as a friend and the friendship is weatherproof. No matter who becomes the leader on each side, the relationship is always well maintained. It is almost the same as the United States and Israel. Nevertheless, China has never asked Pakistan to follow a socialist ideology and implement China-­like policies. In fact, as a Muslim country with national and local elections and parliamentary politics, ideologically and politically, <span aria-label="228" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Pakistan is as far away as one can think from China. The Chinese side is not at all concerned by this.</p>

  <p class="text">There are many sources of suspicion regarding China’s claims that it does not wish to export its ideology or political system. One comes from the observation of the Chinese government setting up many branches of the so-­called Confucius Institutes next to many universities outside China. But these schools are all devoted to teaching Chinese languages and cultures. None of them teaches how great the Chinese Communist Party is, how wonderful the Chinese political system is, and how other countries should follow China.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">6. Home </span><span class="italic">Sweet Home</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">This is a commonly shared view by many Chinese going abroad: The goal of going abroad is to return home with fortune and glory instead of occupying foreign land and making it our home. This is what I call the Chinese mentality of “home, sweet home.” And this explains well why overseas Chinese oftentimes are not as integrated into local politics as their economic success would imply. In history and throughout modern times, many Chinese have gone abroad either to study or more likely to escape war and famine. For them, the immediate goal is of course to make a better living, but their ultimate goal is to achieve fortune or fame in a foreign land in order to receive a hero’s welcome when they return home. In Chinese, there is a popular saying describing this: “to do well in the outside world and then dress up well, return home, and be received with honor and glory.” For those who are not fortunate enough to achieve success abroad, they will still need to return home once they reach old age. The popular saying is that “one needs to land in the homeland like a falling leaf on the root of the tree.” Chinese people travel to other countries as visitors and sometimes immigrants, but rarely or ever colonists.</p>

  <p class="text">The story of Mr. Wu Shunde is a good illustration. His father had already been a successful businessman in Malaysia for many <span aria-label="229" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229" role="doc-pagebreak"/>decades when Shunde was born in 1912 in Malaysia. Many Chinese were forced to go abroad because of war or famine. When he was two years old, his parents sent him back to China’s Guangdong to receive formal education with the goal of making sure the family had good connections with their homeland. Wu attended Lingnan College, a Catholic school in Guangzhou. He later conducted business in Hong Kong. He eventually came to own the second-­largest company in Hong Kong in terms of employment, the Maxim Group, which manages chains of restaurants ranging from formal and expensive Cantonese restaurants to cafeteria-­style fast food. His extended family now owns the whole Starbucks franchise in greater China. When he became successful in business, Wu donated money mostly in mainland China, including five buildings at Tsinghua University, such as that of the School of Economics and Management and the School of Public Policy. My small complaint is that the buildings are all similarly named after him, so my ordered lunch boxes are often misdelivered.</p>

  <p class="text">Jo<a id="_idTextAnchor002"/>hn Cecil Rh<a id="_idTextAnchor003"/>odes was just the opposite of many Chinese like Wu Shunde. Rhodes was one of the most famous British colonial entrepreneurs in the late nineteenth century. He made his fortune in the countries now known as South Africa, Mozambique, and the countries then known as Northern and Southern Rhodesia (Zambia and Zimbabwe today). He was once one of the world’s richest people, monopolizing the supply of diamonds from South Africa. His company, De Beers, now belongs to the Anglo American Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

  <p class="text">Rhodes’s dream was not to return home with fancy clothing and glory, but to expand the British empire. He even deeply regretted that America had gained independence. As a bachelor with no heirs, he faced the issue of how to allocate his huge amount of wealth after his death. He decided to donate his money to the cause of expanding and reviving the glorious days of Great Britain. For this, he initially wanted to work with Nathan Rothschild, another tycoon of the time; Rothschild politely refused. <span aria-label="230" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Ultimately, Rhodes donated most of his wealth to Oxford University, establishing the Rhodes Scholarship. The original purpose of the Rhodes Scholarship was to train the brightest future leaders of the English-­speaking world, including Australia and the United States, in order to create loyalty toward Britain among the elites and eventually lead to a return of British rule in those countries.</p>

  <p class="text">No matter how successful Mr. Wu was in the pursuit of his personal goal, his ultimate dream was to return home to China to be respected by the Chinese people. “Home sweet home” was always in Wu Shunde’s mind, whereas the dream of John Cecil Rh<a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>odes was to expand the influence of his home country.</p>

  <p class="text">This difference in behavior and mentality still persists among today’s young Chinese students. When my generation went abroad to study in Western countries, many of us had the dream of returning to China to excel in career development. Today that mentality has grown even stronger. Many young Chinese are not willing to study overseas, and those who do intend to return home as early as possible after earning their degrees. According to a report by Huaqiao University based in Fujian, China, 80 percent of Chinese students who studied abroad from 2010 to 2020 have returned to China, rather than staying in foreign countries. This is consistent with my casual observations.</p>

  <p class="text">The Chinese word for China literally translates to “Middle Kingdom.” I would argue that this does not necessarily refer to a political concept, but rather expresses the idea of home—­central to the mindset of many Chinese. This is why most of the Chinese dynasties of the past two thousand years were not expansionary. In fact, the most expansionary dynasties were led by the Mongolians or the Manchurians, who were invaders from the North and then came to rule the whole country.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">7. The Business of Diplomacy Is Business</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">While President Trump made a splash by combining business with diplomacy and geopolitics in his first foreign visit after <span aria-label="231" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231" role="doc-pagebreak"/>taking office, Chinese leaders have long made it routine to witness the signing of a large number of business agreements during visits by foreign businesspeople. For example, I have been the only academic member of the Sino-­German Economic Advisory Council, consisting of one academic and twelve business executives on each side. One benefit for business executives in joining the committee is to be able to push for business deals with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, which is often responsible for giving the green light to Chinese foreign projects before a state visit of a Chinese leader to Germany or a German leader to China. Such state visits accelerate many business deals.</p>

  <p class="text">When a Chinese leader plans to visit African or other developing countries, Chinese businesses would always line up business deals. The special state-­chartered flights would be full of business executives accompanying Chinese leaders, and they would later sign business deals in the presence of the leaders.</p>

  <p class="text">Behind this pattern of Chinese behavior is the philosophy that economic development should be promoted across countries. Chinese leaders often argue that the right of economic development should be a part of human rights and one of the most impor­tant ones for people in a poor country; that is, to benefit from economic development and to have opportunities to participate in economic development is as impor­tant as political freedom and freedom of speech. In the language of Chinese leaders, the foundation of political freedom is economic development, and economic development emanates from international collaboration and investment. It is wrong, the rationale goes, to first demand that a foreign country obey certain political rules, develop rule of law, and adopt democracy before agreeing to do business.</p>

  <p class="text">In Chinese philosophy, one has to push for economic growth first; political development will come later as a consequence of a higher quality of life. This often ignites a dispute between China and Western countries. Western countries tend to precondition <span aria-label="232" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232" role="doc-pagebreak"/>their business deals and economic aid on political freedom and human rights.</p>

  <p class="H2"><span class="italic">8. China Should Work with the United States . . . </span><span class="italic">with Principles</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">China should work with the United States while standing firm for China’s own long-­term interests. Yes. You read that right. This is still the dominant view inside China, despite the surging hawkish US attitudes toward China starting with the Trump presidency.</p>

  <p class="text">The Chinese nickname for the United States reveals the true image of the United States in the minds of most Chinese. Americans and their country are called: the “Old Americans” (alternatively translated as the Big Americans). In Chinese, “old” is not necessarily a reference to age. It is a prefix added to someone’s last name in order to describe a person who is the most senior in rank, or physically strong and big, bossy, confident, stubborn, self-­centered, and often times, grumpy. In contrast, the Chinese would never use the phrase “Old Japanese.” Instead, they say “Little Japanese,” which refers to Japanese who often appear to be very modest, polite, and clever. These nicknames are of course stereotyping and I disagree with them, but they are reflective of the Chinese perception. In the minds of most Chinese, America remains the “big boss,” and the “big boss” might not always be reasonable—­it can be grumpy like an old grandfather.</p>

  <p class="text">The majority of Chinese believe that dealing appropriately with the United States is China’s top priority in international affairs. Some people go as far as to argue that without the United States, China’s forty years of economic reform and opening up would not have been as successful. Furthermore, most educated people in China agree that the current world order, essentially established by the United States at the end of World War II, has been more or less beneficial to China for the past four decades. This view is consistent with the fact that China is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="233" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Facing the increasingly hawkish stance of the United States toward China, is there a consensus view among most people in China? This is a difficult question since the China-­US relationship is a hot and divisive topic in China. Aside from the ultra-­nationalistic or the highly pro-­Western views, the middle or consensus view seems to be rather clear. The consensus view is that facing pressure from the United States, China needs to respect and negotiate with the United States as the “Old American” but stand firm and not give in on issues of long-­term interest to China. Such issues generally include that of Taiwan and policy options to promote continued economic and technological progress.</p>

  <p class="text">The Russia–­Ukraine war is a good illustration of China’s cautious, restrained, and principled dealings with the United States. China had been friendly with both Russia and Ukraine for decades before the war. In fact, Chinese business had invested heavily in Ukraine, including a few large grain warehouses that were destroyed in the war. Therefore, the top priority is for China to broker a peace agreement between the two countries, and this would also enhance China’s leadership profile in the world. Meanwhile, China does want to maintain its good relations with Russia, with which China has one of the world’s longest borders. A highly sensitive issue is whether China should placate Moscow’s appetite for military equipment, as this will irritate the United States and its allies. Taking all these considerations into account, China has played a nuanced role in the conflict, trying to broker peace, maintaining good relations with Russia, but stopping short of selling military equipment to Russia.</p>

  <p class="text">An example of standing firm against US pressure by promoting China’s own technological innovation is Huawei. Long before President Trump’s policy of cutting off Chinese high-­tech companies from American suppliers, some high-­tech companies such as Huawei began working on a contingency plan that they internally referred to as the “spare tire,” intending to establish their own operating systems and computer chips just in case the United <span aria-label="234" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234" role="doc-pagebreak"/>States were to cut them out of the computer technology ecosystem. This was only meant to serve as a backup plan that would never have to be implemented. But by 2019, many companies realized that the possibility of having to use their “spare tires” was increasing substantially. In September 2020, Huawei officially launched the Harmony OS, which is an operating system not only used by mobile phones and laptops, but also by all devices hooked up to the 5G network. The Harmony system would not have been developed had the US administration not treated Huawei as an unreliable entity.</p>

  <p class="text">Now that I have illustrated and argued that the rise of China most likely will continue and China has its unique approach to managing the country’s affairs and its own set of world views, a natural question is: Will the rise of China be good or bad for the rest of the world, including the West? In the next and final chapter of the book, I argue that the rise of China will be good for common people in the rest of the world.</p>
