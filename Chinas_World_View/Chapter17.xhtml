  <h1 class="chapter-title-3" id="sigil_toc_id_17"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter17"><span class="running-head">Why Is the <br/>Rise of China <br/>Good for the World?</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the last chapter of the book, building on the analysis of previous chapters, I argue that the rise of China is good for the world and more specifically, the rise of China is good for the common people of the world. I first explain that the rise of China will not cause a war, cold nor hot, between China and the United States, despite the fact that many scholars have predicted or even argued for such a war. My main argument is that China has not been following the path of the rise of a Western power and therefore such predictions for a China-­US war based on Western history are not applicable. I then explain that the rise of China will provide new economic opportunities for most people in the world. Also, the rise of China will bring more global public goods such as faster progress in science and technology, space exploration, peacekeeping in war-­torn regions, and a more effective fight against climate change. In addition, the rise of China will raise the pressure of competition and therefore push many countries, including the United States, to spend more on science, technology, and education, which is beneficial for these countries.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Many politicians and policy </span>analysts in the West, especially those in the United States, have identified China as <span aria-label="236" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the biggest strategic enemy. Former US president Trump certainly made a critical contribution in this regard. Even before COVID-­19 and during his campaign for election, he labeled China as the biggest and most present danger to the United States, just like the former Soviet Union. While in office, copying a Cold War tactic, he shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston with only seventy-­two hours’ notice in July 2020. This was a particularly symbolic decision: The Houston consulate was the very first one opened as a result of Deng Xiaoping’s historic visit to the United States in 1979, during which Deng stopped by Houston and snapped a charming photo wearing a cowboy hat. Besides the incident of the Houston consulate, four Chinese scholars were arrested by the FBI for allegedly hiding their history of employment with the Chinese military. Chinese hi-­tech company Huawei, despite being a privately held company, was also blocked from buying computer chips from all companies under US influence. On top of these events, President Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made a shocking speech proclaiming that the past fifty years of US engagement with China had been a failure, and that China was an evil force to be met with resistance and containment. He chose to make the speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum on July 23, 2020, implicating the strategic mistake that President Nixon (of his own party) had made in normalizing relations with China half a century earlier.</p>

  <p class="text">Meanwhile, the US Congress has become increasingly hawkish toward China, even after the Trump presidency. The normally disagreeable and argumentative US Congress has shown a rare solidarity when it comes to proposing legislations condemning China for various problems. In particular, the US Congress passed legislation urging the White House to provide more military and political support for Taiwan with the clear purpose of showing defiance against the Chinese government, while for the past four decades, the US White House has reassured the Chinese <span aria-label="237" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237" role="doc-pagebreak"/>government that Taiwan is part of China and military sales to Taiwan should taper off from the levels of the late 1970s.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There is one general </span>theory and two practical arguments behind the view that the United States and the West should treat China as a strategic enemy. The general theory is often called the Thucydides Trap, which is based on the history of Ancient Greece that when a new power rose, the incumbent power felt challenged and as a consequence, wars between the new and the incumbent powers broke out. Professor Graham Allison of Harvard University, an expert on the Cold War between the West and the Soviet bloc, is responsible for proposing and publicizing this theory. He published a book in 2017 titled <span class="italic">Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap</span>? He argues that when China grows bigger and stronger, China will face pushback from the world’s incumbent hegemon, the United States, much as in the wars fought between the number one powers and their challengers in ancient Greek times. He argues that World War I was fought between Germany, a rising power, and the UK, the incumbent, and World War II was a sequel to it. In China, quite a number of analysts seem to echo the view of Professor Allison. As early as 2010, a leading media analyst, Peng Xiaoguang, wrote a long article predicting that the United States would turn against China much as the United States waged the Cold War against the Soviet Union after World War II.</p>

  <p class="text">Besides the theory of the Thucydides Trap, there are two specific arguments for why the United States and the West in general should treat China as their biggest strategic enemy. The first concerns ideology and world order. The former secretary of state, Pompeo, and the ex-­vice president, Pence, have made it very clear in their speeches: China is under a non-­Christian and nondemocratic political regime, which has remained unchanged since China and the United States normalized relations in 1979; to <span aria-label="238" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238" role="doc-pagebreak"/>make things worse, the stronger economy that China built with its close economic ties with the United States strengthened rather than weakened its political regime. An extension of this point is that when China keeps on rising, it will challenge and eventually change the world order that the United States and the West have built after World War II. One of the examples of China changing the world order is that China has not been siding with the United States on issues such as sanctioning Iran, Russia, North Korea, and Syria.</p>

  <p class="text">The other specific argument for why China is a strategic enemy is economics. This has often been claimed by former president Trump: The rise of China has been at the expense of the US economy. Many US workers have lost jobs due to companies relocating factories away from the United States to China, and Chinese products are sold at low prices in the US market, outcompeting the remaining US manufacturing firms. Thus it is time for the United States to fight back. Tariffs are a great weapon against China in this regard according to former president Trump.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There are several reasons </span>the Thucydides Trap is not applicable to China and the United States. First of all, the Thucydides Trap theory is based on internal competition within Western civilization. As a simple historical fact, intra-­civilization and civil conflicts are often much more fatal and brutal than inter-­civilization conflicts and international wars. For example, for the past five hundred years, most wars were fought among Western nations, one per year, with the two world wars mostly involving Western nations. Also, American casualties were higher in the US Civil War than they have been in all US foreign wars combined. In China, civil wars, including peasant revolts, have often caused more deaths than wars against other nations.</p>

  <p class="text">Second, and much more impor­tant, historically, most Chinese dynasties of the past two thousand years, with the exceptions of <span aria-label="239" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the Yuan Dynasty ruled by the Mongolians (1271–­1368) and Qing Dynasty ruled by the Manchurians (1636–­1911), were not expansionist and instead practiced a tributary system. In a tributary system, each year foreign ambassadors would pay homage to the emperor to demonstrate respect for him, and the emperor reciprocated with his gifts and might even send one of his daughters to marry the head of a foreign land. The foreign countries were in effect independent and self-­governed. This is totally different from the history of Western colonialism.</p>

  <p class="text">Why have a tributary system rather than territorial expansion? A simple reason is the Confucian doctrine of peaceful coexistence. That is, avoid fighting with neighbors. If fighting is necessary, try to win the war and then retreat in order to win the heart of the new local ruler, and then each year ask the neighbor to pay homage to the Chinese emperor. The idea is that winning the heart brings eternal peace while winning a war brings only temporary peace. And, winning a war is only a means to winning the heart.</p>

  <p class="text">All signs indicate that today’s China follows that cultural tradition of Confucianism and is leaning toward the tributary system rather than the expansionist approach of the exceptional dynasties and emperors.</p>

  <p class="text">In short, it takes two to tango. Given Chinese historical and cultural tradition, the Thucydides Trap theory does not hold.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">I would argue that </span>a China-­US war, cold or hot, is avoidable and unlikely to happen. To begin with, the so-­called Thucydides Trap theory is not applicable to today’s China, despite the attractive simplicity and beauty of the theory with a fancy Greek name. The Thucydidean analysis is based on Western history. Its key assumption is that China is like Germany in the 1910s and the former Soviet Union in the 1930s, or earlier rising powers in Western and Greek histories. In this book, I have gone into details arguing that China is different from all such previous <span aria-label="240" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240" role="doc-pagebreak"/>rising powers. In fact, in the last chapter, I have illustrated China’s unique world view, which is nonexpansionist.</p>

  <p class="text">How about the concern that China will seek to change the world order that the United States and the West have built? Let us not forget that China is in fact a beneficiary of the modern world order with the United Nations, World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank, and International Monetary Fund (IMF) being the pillar institutions. Whenever there are international crises, whether with Iraq, Iran, North Korea, or Syria, China has always called for the UN to play the most prominent role in resolving these issues rather than through unilateral actions by the United States and its allies. The Chinese economy thrived by greatly expanding international trade after joining the WTO, and Chinese policy makers have benefited significantly from the policy advice of the World Bank and the IMF. China has maintained very good working relations with all these international institutions. There is no reason for China to seek to undermine the world order. As a matter of fact, it is the United States that failed to pay its dues to the United Nations and often complained about the World Bank and the IMF, and even withdrew its membership from the WTO.</p>

  <p class="text">Will China seek to form alliances to challenge the United States and the West? The answer is clearly no. Unlike the former Soviet Union, China is not built upon an ideology that it seeks to export. In addition, as has been argued previously, unlike Germany of the 1910s and the 1930s, China’s foreign relations are centered around the idea of obtaining respect rather than real interests. One example I discussed in other chapters in the book is that China does not try and has not tried to cultivate its own satellite countries. Another example is that despite having already become the world’s largest trader relying on ocean freight, China does not have and has not attempted to build any military base overseas, while the United States had maintained 374 overseas military bases by the end of 2022. China has shown no intention <span aria-label="241" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_241" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of challenging the United States in this regard. In short, I have illustrated several times in the book that China’s world view takes “doing our homework” as task number one. China is not a global expansionary force. It is not seeking to expand its territory, nor is it seeking to export its ideology.</p>

  <p class="text">Will China fight a war with the United States over Taiwan? The answer again is no. To begin with, unlike Crimea, which had not been recognized by most countries as part of Russia before Russia annexed it by force in 2014, Taiwan has been recognized as part of China by almost all countries except for a dozen small ones. Most impor­tantly, mainland China and Taiwan still have a good chance to negotiate some kind of peaceful union in which Taiwan has the utmost autonomy, including keeping its military force, and is much more independent than Hong Kong and Macao. This would allow mainland China to claim that it has accomplished the mission of reunification, therefore ending the so-­called Century of Humiliation. In the unlikely and unfortunate scenario of the Taiwanese authorities declaring independence and the mainland being cornered into waging a military campaign, it is very unlikely for the United States to be involved militarily, since there is no US legislation committing the White House to make such a decision. More impor­tantly, one hundred miles off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan would be a highly asymmetrical theater of war between mainland China and the United States. The Chinese military has played out this scenario time and again. The US White House and Pentagon will be extremely reluctant to engage in a military conflict with China in this region, knowing that China has much more political will and stronger military capacity in such a war than in the case of the Korean War, 1950–­1953, in which the United States and its allies did not prevail.</p>

  <p class="text">Will China and the United States fight a war in the South China Sea, where China also has sovereign claims over many islands? Again, it is unlikely. The issue of the South China Sea is not as severe as it is interpreted to be by many people in the West. China <span aria-label="242" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242" role="doc-pagebreak"/>has not claimed sovereignty over the entire area of the South China Sea. Rather, it only claims many islands within the South China Sea. Additionally, China has repeatedly shown a willingness to work with many countries on economic development in the region, such as by sharing the economic benefits of oil drilling, while putting aside the sovereignty issue of the islands. For the United States, there is a vague notion that as a superpower, it needs to continue projecting its influence and authority in the South China Sea region. However, waging a military campaign in the region just for the vanity of supremacy would be excessively costly for both China and the United States.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Most people in the </span>United States and the West do not understand or even care about the issues of ideology or the world order, and may not be able to point out on a map where Taiwan and the South China Sea are, but they care about a simple question: Is the rise of China good for me and for my children? This is a simple and fundamentally impor­tant question, since in a democracy like the United States, the answer to this question strongly influences whether China and the United States will be headed toward a significant conflict.</p>

  <p class="text">Based on the analyses in this book, I argue that the rise of China is good for common people around the world, including people in the United States, and that people like former president Trump are wrong in claiming that the rise of China has caused economic damage to people in the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">There are three impor­tant factors making the rise of China beneficial to people in the United States and the rest of the world. The first and most obvious factor is the enlarged size of the world’s market economy due to the rise of China, which implies more economic opportunities and benefits for the rest of the world. China is home to about 18 percent of the world’s population. A half-­century ago, China was not connected to the world economy. <span aria-label="243" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_243" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Now, China is very much a critical part of the world economy. China is currently home to 18 percent of the world’s economic activities, and this share is still rapidly increasing. In the following, I lay out specifically how the huge and still increasing Chinese market benefits people outside China.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">Lower </span><span class="smallcaps">Product Prices</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">A highly visible benefit of the rise of the Chinese economy is that the prices of many goods sold in superstores have been kept very low, and this has helped low-­income families everywhere. For the past four decades until 2021, most countries in the world have mostly avoided the problem of high inflation. Besides prudent monetary policy in most developed countries, the rise of China also has been an impor­tant factor.</p>

  <p class="text">Consider the Dollar Store franchises in the United States, where every good used to be sold for $1 and only in recent years moved up to $1.25. Such stores have been in operation for over twenty years without significantly changing their prices. How is such a business model possible? The answer is China. Almost all goods sold in these stores are produced entirely or partially in China.</p>

  <p class="text">A specific example of the benefits of low-­cost Chinese production in the rest of the world can be seen in the community of audiophiles, who treasure specialized equipment such as amplifiers with vacuum tubes. Such equipment was previously very expensive because it requires skilled labor to weld together the electronic components. As China has risen, the price of amplifiers with vacuum tubes has fallen into a much more affordable range—­a few hundred US dollars rather than a few thousand US dollars. There are many more products than just vacuum tube amplifiers that are now made in China for the rest of the world.</p>

  <p class="text">In the economy overall, how large is the contribution of goods made in China to lower inflation and a lower cost of living for people in the United States? A study by economists of the Federal <span aria-label="244" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2011 showed that about 2.7 percent of US household consumption comes from China. Another study, published by the <span class="italic">Journal of International Economics</span> in 2020, estimated that Chinese exports to the United States helped reduce inflation by 0.49 percent per year between 2000 and 2006. Meanwhile, the inflation target of most central banks is 2 percent, and the US inflation rate was mostly below 2 percent between 2000 and 2019 before President Trump’s tariff. In short, the Chinese contribution to helping control US inflation was significant.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">More Jobs</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The rise of China also means more job and career opportunities for people outside China. One high-­profile example of this is the story of Stephon Marbury, a former NBA star. He was drafted as the fourth pick by the NBA in 1996 as a future superstar. Unfortunately, instead of flying high in his NBA career, he ran into troubles on and off the court. Half persuaded by a Chinese sports agent, he decided to sign a contract with the Beijing Ducks and try his chances in the budding Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). To everybody’s surprise, including himself, he excelled in China, helping his club win three CBA championships. He was nicknamed the political commissar, meaning that he is a leader and motivator for his teammates. He was deeply loved by his fans. After retiring from the Beijing Ducks, he competed successfully to become the head coach of another club in the city of Beijing in 2020 and helped turn around the performance of his new club. The moral of the story is simple: Those who have not done well in their home country may achieve success in China! Marbury is not alone. Each CBA club has a few foreign stars, mostly from the United States. They bring with them coaches, trainers, and assistants. Altogether, in China’s CBA, there is a contingent of over one hundred basketball professionals from the United States, Europe, <span aria-label="245" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_245" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and Australia working in China. Other professional sports are the same, thanks to the expanding Chinese sports markets.</p>

  <p class="text">How many jobs has the growing Chinese economy created outside China? After all, not everyone can be a sports star like Stephon Marbury. There are no official statistics, but we can do a quick estimation. Each year, China imports about one trillion US dollars of goods from OECD countries (about 48 percent of all Chinese imports), which are mostly the Western countries plus Japan and Korea, and those imports have been growing at a pace of roughly 8–­10 percent. Most of the imported goods from OECD countries are manufactured products rather than crude oil or minerals. How many jobs does one trillion USD of products create? The average product an OECD worker produces in a year is 83,000 USD (47 USD per hour multiplied by 1,769 hours of work per year). This results in 12 million jobs, which is about 2.2 percent of the OECD’s total employment of 557 million. This is about 11 percent of the OECD’s total employment in agriculture and manufacturing, since most of China’s imported goods are agricultural and manufactured products and the OECD’s average ratio of manufacturing and agriculture to total jobs is around 20 percent. This means that in the West plus Japan and Korea, one out of fifty jobs in the whole economy and one out of nine jobs in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors are serving the Chinese market.</p>

  <p class="text">Who are the laborers producing for the Chinese market? They are the farmers in the US Midwest, who rely heavily on China for their corn and soybean sales. They are the fertilizer producers in the United States. They are the car manufacturers in Detroit and Munich, whose high-­end models are strategically produced in corporate headquarters for the sake of maintaining brand authenticity, but whose biggest sales are in China. They are also the small family workshops making niche products for audiophiles and sportscar parts, who get their biggest orders from China.</p>

  <p class="text">Besides agriculture and manufacturing, let us not forget the <span aria-label="246" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246" role="doc-pagebreak"/>service sector jobs associated with, if not created by, the rise of the Chinese economy. Outstanding among them are education and tourism. Before COVID-­19, each year, there had been as many as 155 million Chinese visits to the rest of the world, at least 50 percent going to OECD countries (the other popular destinations are the Southeast Asian countries). Each tourist spent on average 1,600 USD. This means 124 billion USD of services in total for the OECD countries, which have 27 million employees in the tourism sector, each job creating 68,000 USD in monetary value a year. This means that Chinese tourists helped create 1.84 million jobs, or about 6.8 percent of the total employment in tourism. In other words, one out of fifteen tourism professionals in OECD countries serves Chinese tourists.</p>

  <p class="text">Education is another sector in which the rise of China has created new demand for foreign countries, especially the United States. As of 2019, each year, about 660 thousand Chinese students go abroad, mostly studying in colleges, with 42 percent going to the United States. Tuition and room and board for the majority of them is paid by their parents who, as I explained in the chapter on education, are often more than willing to spend on their children’s education. In the United States, each student easily spends as much as 80,000 USD per year on tuition plus room and board. The total number of Chinese students studying in the United States is about 400,000, spending a total amount of 32 billion USD. This amount is roughly equivalent to the United States exporting 10 percent of its total automobile output to China.</p>

  <p class="text">Of course, the increase of Chinese exports to the rest of the world has meant that many factories, companies, and workers in the United States and the West have been replaced. As many people have argued, this should not be taken as evidence that the rise of China is damaging to Western society. A careful analysis shows that the proportion of manufacturing employment in the United States is already very low—­less than 10 percent of the US population is directly involved in manufacturing. Therefore, <span aria-label="247" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_247" role="doc-pagebreak"/>even without the rise of China, manufacturing jobs would move toward Southeast Asia, India, or Africa. The West is thus left with the challenge of transitioning from manufacturing to other sectors, including the service sector.</p>

  <p class="text">The new jobs outside China created by the rise of China require necessary and proactive adjustments by enterprises and workers. Workers need to move to sectors that cater to the demand of a rising Chinese market, including education, tourism, and premium manufactured products. The process might be difficult, and it is the responsibility of the relevant government to smooth the adjustment. The Chinese government also had to do this for its own economy because many previously profitable factories went bankrupt due to the competition from imports.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">Mitigating the Damage of </span><span class="smallcaps">Financial Crisis</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">China, due to its high savings rate and cautious management of its economy, as discussed above, has been holding trillions of dollars of foreign assets and has become increasingly impor­tant as a force that can help mitigate the impact of financial crises in the rest of the world. For many reasons, the US and European economies have had financial crises or panics every ten to fifteen years, or even more frequently. Most recently, in early 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Credit Suisse (CS) caused widespread panics. Although the SVB and CS panics occurred on the heels of the balloon incident, preventing US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from visiting China, it is widely believed that her team coordinated closely with their Chinese counterparts in order to stabilize the global financial markets. In the case of the European debt crisis between 2010 and 2015, the EU leaders worked hard to woo China to invest in their bailout funds. Although it was unclear in the end how much China invested in such funds, China made a large number of real investments on the ground in European <span aria-label="248" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ports and road building. Such investments helped maintain European jobs and sped up economic recovery.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">More Global Public Goods with Contributions </span><span class="smallcaps">from China</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The rise of China benefits ordinary people in the world by providing public goods from China. Public goods are goods that each of us need and all of us can share. One example is scientific knowledge. Such knowledge leads us to better treatment of disease or cleaner energy for the whole world. Every year, more than four million Chinese college students graduate with degrees in science and engineering. The cream of the crop in academic performance among these graduates go on to conduct scientific research. As modern science is now mostly experimental and is extremely dependent on millions of hours of input by junior scientists, it is therefore very costly in labor. The rapid increase of Chinese college graduates has provided the US and other Western universities and research institutions with a huge supply of scientific labor. Check out the website of any department of natural science of a university in the United States or other Western countries, and 50 percent of the graduate students or junior scientists are easily from China. The average pay for them is much lower than that of a manufacturing worker in the United States, and therefore, there has been a shortage of supply of US students for this kind of work. The influx of Chinese students has become a lifeline of scientific research in the United States and the West. No wonder that whenever the US government considers cutting down on student visas from China, US universities are united in fighting against it.</p>

  <p class="text">Another example of a public good is space exploration, and here China has also made meaningful contributions. The need to build space stations explains itself: It is not done just to whet the curiosity of a few scientists or the vanity of involved nations; it is also impor­tant because we human beings must prepare for the <span aria-label="249" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249" role="doc-pagebreak"/>days when we have to migrate to outer space or to another planet. Furthermore, scientific experiments are also done in space stations, often with immediate benefits. One example is that new and better seeds of grains, vegetables, and fruits can be bred in outer space much faster than on earth. The United States, together with Russia and the European Union, agreed to build an international space station in 1998. The United States has spent roughly 100 billion USD, about 650 USD per taxpayer, on this project. Unfortunately, the space station will stop functioning by 2030 due to a lack of continued funding. China wanted to collaborate with the United States and build a joint space program, but the United States said no to China due to a lack of trust. China went ahead on its own. With a much lower cost in engineers’ salaries, China had already built a space station by 2022 and keeps expanding it. Meanwhile, the US, Russian, and European program faces significant challenges due to the Ukraine crisis and a lack of funding. Decades or even centuries from now, the whole human race will benefit from the efforts today in building and maintaining space stations. China is making a contribution to the whole world. It is ideal and also probable that China, the United States, and other countries will collaborate on this. Besides the many benefits such collaboration could bring to the world, the United States would be able to avoid spending its valuable tax revenue on such programs. The rise of Chinese economic capacity makes this possible.<span class="endnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter17.xhtml#footnote-009">10</a></span></span></p>

  <p class="text">International peacekeeping is another example of a public good. There are many regions in the world suffering from the lack of basic law and order. The ensuing fights often spiral into regional military conflicts and cause a huge exodus of refugees to the rest <span aria-label="250" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of the world, which has been a headache for the West. Maintaining law and order in such regions is a public good for everyone in the world. International peacekeeping is a United Nations program to deploy military forces in war-­torn regions in order to maintain law and order. It is not a controversial program of the UN, since the military forces are only deployed to regions where fighting parties have already agreed to a truce. The peacekeeping program of the UN has made impor­tant contributions to many otherwise unstable regions. By now, China has become the largest contributor to the peacekeeping troops in terms of military personnel and funds. China has stated that it is willing to contribute more to the peacekeeping program. With more collaborations between China, the United States, and other countries, it is imaginable that the UN peacekeeping program can grow much bigger.</p>

  <p class="text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a leading issue on which China and the United States are likely to coordinate closely, since both sides, as large nations, have a common stake in its safe development, just as the Soviet Union and the United States worked effectively to prevent a nuclear war. AI, if not properly developed, poses potentially fatal danger for humankind, just like nuclear technology. China and the United States, as leading countries in AI, will have to cooperate to come up with something like a constitution of AI, prohibiting certain kinds of AI development.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">A More Effective Fight against </span><span class="smallcaps">Climate Change</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">China will arguably be the most impor­tant country in helping to lower the cost of the fight against climate change and speeding up this fight. This can be demonstrated in monetary terms. In the United States and the West, as of 2022, the cost to reduce carbon levels can be as high as 70 USD per metric ton. If you bring China into the picture, the cost may come down to as low as 10 USD. Why? First, China, as a center of manufacturing for the world, has <span aria-label="251" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251" role="doc-pagebreak"/>become the world’s largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide since around 2005. Meanwhile, China has also been rapidly investing in green technology. Therefore, reducing a unit of carbon in China is much cheaper than in Europe, where old technologies are slower to be phased out than in China. More impor­tantly, China is home to 70 percent of the production capacity for the world’s solar panels and 50 percent for wind turbines, at only a fraction of the cost that it would be in other parts of the world. The huge and low-­cost supply of solar panels and wind turbines helps speed up the process of fighting against climate change. On climate change, China has already garnered cost-­effective carbon neutral technologies. For example, China has used its super low-­cost solar and wind energy to produce methanol to replace coal, gasoline, and diesel and use it in redesigned internal combustion engines. The United States, intending to continue being a global leader, will push for effective technologies to reach carbon neutral for the world and therefore will work closely with China in this regard.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">China Provides Competition That the United States and the</span><span class="smallcaps"> West Need</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The third and perhaps the most interesting avenue in which the rise of China helps the West, especially the United States, is through competition and rivalry. No doubt, the rise of China has caused a widespread sense of urgency in the United States and other Western countries in general to make sure that they don’t fall behind. In many ways, this is an impetus for the United States and the West to speed up necessary social reforms.</p>

  <p class="text">Take the example of US federal expenditures in science and technology. For many years, despite repeated and extensive calls from the US communities of higher education and science and technology, the United States has been steadily cutting its budgetary allocation to these areas. This has been mainly due to <span aria-label="252" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252" role="doc-pagebreak"/>budgetary pressure facing the US federal government. There is mounting evidence that cutting funding for scientific research will hurt the long-­term competitiveness of the US economy, even though the private sector may fill some of the gaps left by the funding cuts. By early 2020, the trend of a declining federal budget for science and technology was suddenly reversed, and it took the so-­called China threat to get it done. Senator Chuck Schumer from the state of New York, one of the most outspoken China bashers on Capitol Hill in the United States, whom I met and found to be an eloquent and passionate politician in a Tsinghua classroom during his very first trip to China, proposed a piece of legislation called the Endless Frontier Act in 2020. The Act calls for a massive increase in the amount the US federal budget allocates for science and technology, increasing from 10 billion USD a year for the National Science Foundation to 100 billion USD in total for five years to come. The Act was instantly welcomed by presidents of leading US universities. The direct motivation: China. Senator Schumer’s argument was straightforward: Without such a program, the United States will fall behind China in areas like AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, etc. His list covers as many as fifteen key areas. The US economy and society will benefit from such an act, based on historical experience. After many modifications, the Endless Frontier Act eventually became a law by August 2022. Even though the Act has many anti-­China provisions, it will have a major impact on US scientific research.</p>

  <p class="text">Education is another example in which the perceived threat and competition from China motivates US and Western policy makers to make progressive changes and to try to explore reforms. There is a general sense that the US education system at the precollege level overall has been lacking intensity in general and has been very weak in particular in the STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) area. This is obviously an extremely complicated topic. But in policy debates, the word “China,” or more specifically, “Shanghai,” is motivational, since <span aria-label="253" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253" role="doc-pagebreak"/>many cross-­country studies rank China (oftentimes choosing Shanghai as the representative city, a biased choice) to be on top, way above the United States. Without getting into the details of the debate, I believe that there is a consensus among US policy makers and education experts that something has to be done to put more resources into the US education system. Vice versa, in China, the United States is a perennial motivation for educational reforms. Interestingly, education experts in China often cite universities like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, and high schools like the Phillips Academy, as examples of how creative the US education system is in cultivating talents and by contrast, how bad the Chinese system has been. Competition works! Both China and the United States are attempting to improve their own education systems, using each other as motivation.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">I have argued repeatedly </span>that the rise of China is good for the United States and the West, but how do individuals in the West benefit from the rise of China? I have two specific suggestions, mostly for young people. But before going into the specifics, I cannot emphasize enough that one needs to avoid the mistake of stereotyping people according to culture and nationality. All Chinese people are different, just as all Americans, Europeans, and Indians are different. One must be open-­minded and patient in understanding a country or a culture.</p>

  <p class="text">Given this premise, my first suggestion is to study basic Chinese in order to understand the culture. Language is a conveyor of culture, and culture is essentially a set of norms about how people behave. This especially applies to young people. The Chinese language is a particularly easy language to start learning because the grammar not only uses the same system as English (the most used international language) but also is simpler than English. It is perhaps the easiest and simplest grammar of all languages, and therefore the payoff-­to-­effort ratio is extremely high in learning <span aria-label="254" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254" role="doc-pagebreak"/>beginning Chinese. Of course, the best way to learn a foreign language for a young person is to make friends with people from the other country and never be shy in asking questions about the language. The Chinese language provides an invaluable window into understanding the country as a whole. For example, when two Chinese first meet, they may say to each other <span class="italic">Xing Hui</span>, meaning that it is a good fortune to meet you. The implied meaning is that of all the countless people in the world, you and I meet, this is a serendipity, and we should treasure it and let us hope good things will happen.</p>

  <p class="text">My second suggestion is to visit China if you have not done so, or at least get a copy of a Chinese map. No matter how much you read or watch reports on the internet, you can never really understand a country without carefully reading the map and actually visiting it. Nowadays, with the world’s largest network of rapid rail and almost the largest volume of air traffic, tourist facilities are highly developed and many tour options are available. Even more impor­tantly, generally speaking, China is a very safe country for tourists. And when you visit, you will almost certainly develop an entirely new perspective on the country and the culture. You may even discover opportunities for professional development or business collaboration.</p>

  <p class="text _idGenParaOverride-1">I am very confident that by acquiring a basic knowledge of Chinese and visiting China, a person will open up a window of new opportunities. It will be as exciting as some of my generation of Chinese who have had the good fortune to study English or other Western languages during the past decades and then to study in countries like the United States. Our lives were transformed and, in turn, we helped many fellow Chinese change their lives. The same surely can be said of young generations in the rest of the world.</p>

In recent years, they have entered the business of space travel and greatly lowered the cost of launching rockets. However, it is unlikely that they will be able to replace the role of publicly funded programs, which are for pure science exploration and mostly will not be profitable.</p>
