  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t can never be overemphasized that in order to understand today’s China, one must develop a deep understanding of the Chinese Communist Party. Toward this goal, in this chapter, I explain three simple but very impor­tant points. First, as the largest political party in the world, the Chinese Communist Party comprehensively governs the country from each village or city building to the very top. Second, before assuming national power, the Chinese Communist Party fought through twenty-two years of brutal military wars, suffered from many catastrophic setbacks, and learned in harsh ways that in order to win and stay in power, they have to be pragmatic and adaptive. In this regard, the Party is very different from those in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Third, the party is delicately organized and managed, drawing on thousands of years of Chinese history of political governance. Meritocracy is a principle that has been inherited from history.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">In China, there’s a</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">saying</span>: The party leads everything. This refers to the fact that the party manages all critical social affairs of society. The institutions of the party overlap with those of the government; it has<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>the authority to preside over government decisions at both central and local levels.</p>

  <p class="text">As a result, the party is huge in membership and its organization <span aria-label="35" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stretches all the way from the center of political power down to the grassroots level. With 96.71 million party members by mid-­2022, the basic party units serve as an effective avenue for mobilizing resources and managing societal affairs. The best and most recent illustration of this has been the role of grassroots party units in combating COVID-­19, when they were tasked with enforcing lockdowns, monitoring quarantines, and ensuring that residents could access the necessary groceries and supplies. This would be as if in the United States, President Biden issued a compulsory vaccine policy and the local branches of his Democratic Party were responsible for enforcing such a policy. Obviously, the Democratic Party does not have such a capacity. In reality, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, with a size about half that of the Chinese Communist Party, are mostly focused on getting their candidates elected as opposed to everyday governance.</p>

  <p class="text">Because it plays such a central role in governance, and due to its unique history, the party has always had a founding mission. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, the founding mission of the party has been further articulated. In his own words, the mission of the party is to seek well-­being for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. To an outsider, the party’s founding mission is not too different from that of other strong political parties around the world such as the People’s Action Party of Singapore or Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party.</p>

  <p class="text">Therefore, a simple question arises: Given the well-­articulated mission of the party, why put “communism” in its name? This is obviously an impor­tant question that few people ask in China. Many people in the world, including conservative politicians, have developed their hatred for the party because of the term <span class="italic">communism</span>. The most impor­tant answer is: history. In 1921, founders of the party, including Mao Zedong, drew their inspiration from the Russian October Revolution in 1917. They believed that the October Revolution was not only a victory of the poor but also that Russia would become a fair, strong, and prosperous nation <span aria-label="36" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36" role="doc-pagebreak"/>after the revolution. And they believed that this is what China needed. Such a vision was extremely attractive for the young and educated elites in a poor, weak, and proud nation like China. The October Revolution was led by a communist party. Thus, China needed its own communist party.</p>

  <p class="text">It is an interesting and revealing fact that Jiang Zemin, the late former party leader, and his senior colleagues seriously examined the issue of dropping “communism” from the name of the party. This was not long after the collapse of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s. However, the conclusion was a resounding no. Why? “Should we drop Communism out of our name, many who supported us and believed in communism and made tremendous sacrifices will no longer side with us,” said Jiang, according to a senior party theoretician who participated in the discussion. In other words, dropping the term <span class="italic">communism</span> is a betrayal of the party’s history.</p>

  <p class="text">But how does the Chinese Communist Party reconcile itself with the Marxist doctrine that capitalism should be buried and a communist society should be built to replace it? Since the start of reform and opening up, the Chinese Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping has developed a theory that creating a communist society is a goal that will be realized far in the future. Until then, a type of socialism should be promoted in which private ownership of capital should be allowed in order to provide incentives for the economy to develop. Meanwhile, some social inequality should be tolerated so long as most people are making progress in their economic well-­being. In official language, this is called the primitive stage of socialism, and this stage will last a long time. In practice, this means that the party manages the market economy with government intervention to prevent extreme volatility and inequality.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="37" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The history of the </span>Communist Party, which marked its one hundredth anniversary in July 2021, has deeply shaped its character. Its history can be best understood by dividing it into three periods. The first period covers the first fifty-­five years, 1921–­1976, mostly under the leadership of Mao Zedong. The second period covers the next thirty-­five years, mostly under the influence of Deng Xiaoping, 1977–­2011, and the third period started in 2012 under the current leadership of Xi Jinping.</p>

  <p class="text">During Mao’s reign, he was widely revered and viewed as a god within the party. Even today, many people in China retain a great deal of respect for Mao Zedong, although others do not share this view. Among the educated, a discussion of Mao often brings out strong emotions and turns a gathering of family or friends unpleasant. On the other hand, many less-­educated Chinese people still regard Mao as a god and even hang a button showing his picture in their car’s rearview mirror in order to receive his blessing for safe travel. Others less fond of Mao claim that had Mao’s eldest and most favored son not been killed during the Korean War, today’s China might be like North Korea, with the Mao family ruling the country just like the Kim family in North Korea. In any case, Mao certainly is the most impor­tant political figure in modern Chinese history.</p>

  <p class="text">Mao was among the fifteen young men who founded the Communist Party in 1921 in a French enclave in Shanghai, where the police were relatively less aggressive in controlling Marxist movements. Mao was not a key leader during the first ten years of the party. Rather, the leaders were professors and students who had studied Marxism at leading Chinese universities, or in France, Germany, and the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p class="text">Six years after its founding, the Chinese Communist Party ran into a huge crisis: Party members were being massacred by the opposing Nationalist government. Mao had argued that the party needed its own military force, but the scholarly founders of <span aria-label="38" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the party had disagreed. In response, Mao initiated on his own a peasant revolt in 1927 along the border of two provinces where Nationalist control was weak. After the revolt, Mao organized these peasants into a small guerrilla army and set up their base in a mountainous region called Jing Gang Shan. Within a few years, these troops had grown into the Red Army, with a membership of one hundred thousand.</p>

  <p class="text">In the following years, the Communist Party established military bases in southern China with Mao Zedong as one of their leaders. Initially, the bases were extremely politically successful, mobilizing poor farmers to support the Communist Party and its army. Meanwhile, the Red Army was using guerilla war tactics to fight against the all-­powerful Nationalist Party’s army under Chiang Kai-­shek. However, the situation turned drastically worse around 1933, when the Communist League based in Russia began sending senior officials to “guide” the Chinese Communist Revolution. Since the Soviet Communist Party was regarded as the father of all communist parties, their advice was carefully heeded. Mao Zedong was ousted and severely criticized by the party members who had studied in the Soviet Union. The Communist League sent foreign experts to command the Red Army under the leadership of an Austrian named Otto Braun, who wrested military control from Mao. Before coming to China, Braun had been a rising officer in the Austrian-­Hungarian army until he was captured by the Soviets and converted into a Communist. He was treated like a god by the Chinese Communists, but unfortunately, Braun’s military performance in China was anything but godlike. He used German tactics to engage in positional warfare, which played right into the hands of the much better equipped Nationalist Army.</p>

  <p class="text">As a consequence of the military disaster of Mr. Braun, the Red Army was forced to embark on the famous Long March, a brutal eight-­thousand-­mile journey from southern to northern China. By the end of the Long March, the main force of the Red Army <span aria-label="39" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39" role="doc-pagebreak"/>had shrunk from eighty-­five thousand to thirty thousand soldiers. It was during this retreat that Mao was able to demonstrate his military prowess, masterfully executing elaborate maneuvers to escape his opponent’s attacks in a “hit and run” approach. Mao’s success won him a great deal of his supporters, and thus the Long March was the beginning of his ascent to power. Mao would remain the leader of the party until his death in the fall of 1976.</p>

  <p class="text">Despite the fierce conflict with the Nationalists, by 1937, Mao realized that he needed to form an alliance with them in order to have any hope of driving out invading Japanese forces, which posed a grave threat to China. Thus, Mao made tremendous efforts to restrain the Communist Party’s rage against the Nationalists and form a military alliance. This helped the Communist Party survive, because without the alliance, they would have been fighting two wars at the same time. This reversal of strategy from fighting against the Nationalists to forming an alliance with them is a prime example of the Communist Party’s willingness to adapt and be pragmatic in order to survive and succeed. To this day, the Communist Party fully realizes that despite its all-­powerful rule over the country, it faces many dangers and must implement constant changes.</p>

  <p class="text">Eventually, after the Communists and Nationalists prevailed over the Japanese forces, the civil war resumed from 1945 to 1949, when the Communists emerged victorious and founded the People’s Republic of China in October of 1949. So ended the first phase of Mao’s leadership. Overall, most people in China agree that during this first period, Mao was largely wise in his major decisions, ultimately leading the Communists to victory over the Nationalist Party. However, after the Communist Party came into power, Mao made a series of mistakes that are openly acknowledged by the Communist Party, despite Mao’s historical importance. Why does the party openly criticize Mao’s mistakes? It is because many people, including senior party members, were severely affected by his poor policies. To criticize Mao is to <span aria-label="40" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" role="doc-pagebreak"/>protect the party’s authority. The two most severe and openly criticized mistakes were the Great Leap Forward, which occurred during 1957 and 1958, and the Cultural Revolution, between 1966 and 1976.</p>

  <p class="text">The Great Leap Forward began when Mao returned from a visit to the Soviet Union celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. During his three-­week stay in Moscow, he was not impressed by the situation of the Soviet Union, telling his colleagues: “Look at the Russians on the street. They appear to be depressed. China’s socialism should do a better job.” A few weeks after returning from Moscow, in a poetic style, Mao launched a series of campaigns to boost morale and spur mass mobilization. In one campaign, Mao hoped to triple China’s steel output, while in another, he collectivized farmers into production teams. Both moves proved to be disastrous. People melted all kinds of quality hardware, including cooking tools and other necessary devices, and recycled them, artificially increasing steel production. Meanwhile, collectivizing the farmers took away their incentive to work. In many cases, grain farmers actually ate their seeds, expecting to benefit from the crops cultivated by others.</p>

  <p class="text">By 1959, Mao readily recognized that he had made a major mistake with the Great Leap Forward. Though his vision had been to stimulate investment and collectivize farmers, the result was a catastrophic famine. The actual number of deaths during the Great Leap Forward is still under dispute, but many historians agree the number was at least 10 million. In the aftermath of this calamity, in April 1959, Mao stepped down from the presidency of the country, while remaining as the chairman of the party. In effect, he meant to retire from the daily operations of the government and let pragmatic colleagues like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai take over. By 1962, the economy began to recover.</p>

  <p class="text">An impor­tant event in the former Soviet Union sowed the seed for Mao’s second major mistake. Following Joseph Stalin’s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev took his place as the new leader of the <span aria-label="41" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Soviet Union. Barely three years after that, when the Twentieth Party Congress of the Soviet Communist Party had officially concluded, Khrushchev suddenly called an extra session for the next day. He delivered a long report to the stunned delegates in which he harshly criticized Stalin for all his mistakes, kicking off a massive campaign designed to tarnish Stalin’s legacy. Once hailed as a god and hero, Stalin was now publicly crucified as a devil. Back in China, the fact that Mao made a bad decision in the Great Leap Forward, and that his colleague Liu Shaoqi had facilitated the recovery, made Mao extremely uncomfortable and insecure. Mao cared enormously about his legacy and worried that he would suffer a fate similar to Stalin’s. He began to regard other rising party leaders such as Liu with suspicion and embarked on a mission to reclaim and protect his power.</p>

  <p class="text">Mao waged the Cultural Revolution to squash his political opponents—­such as his once favored successor, Liu Shaoqi—­who he suspected would follow Khrushchev’s example. He fought this battle using a kind of grassroots, guerilla tactic. Mao traveled around the country in his specially detailed train, meeting with local officials and attacking the municipal government of Beijing as well as the central government. He asked people: “If China had a revisionist like Khrushchev, what would you do? Would you take my side or the side of the revisionists?” Because Mao was hailed as a god, the people replied, “We’ll follow you.”</p>

  <p class="text">Knowing that some senior officials were disillusioned with the catastrophe of the Great Leap Forward, Mao focused his appeal on young people, including high school and college students. He knew that many young people still worshipped him, as the concept of Mao as a god had been ingrained in them throughout their school years. Mao leveraged his power to call upon these young people to rise up against their leaders, such as their high school principals and university presidents.</p>

  <p class="text">The most famous incident took place at Tsinghua University Affiliated High School, where students answered Mao’s call by <span aria-label="42" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42" role="doc-pagebreak"/>drawing large character posters criticizing their teachers and the school principal. These students signed the posters using the pen name <span class="italic">Red Guards</span>, the personal and loyal guards of Mao. The Red Guards exploded into a massive movement that terrorized local party officials, school personnel, intellectuals, and anyone else labeled as revisionist, <span class="hgkelc">bourgeois, or antirevolutionary. Arguably, the phrase </span><span class="italic">Red Guard</span><span class="hgkelc"> is the most ingenious and successful stroke of political marketing in modern Chinese history.</span> It was coined by a few junior high schoolers at the Tsinghua High School.</p>

  <p class="text">By 1968, all high schools, universities, and most primary schools had ceased operations. All major government agencies had been paralyzed, with their Communist Party branches replaced by revolutionary committees. The court, the procuratorate, and the police had all but stopped functioning. Massive amounts of historical and cultural heritage had been destroyed. China was in chaos. Even the Red Guards themselves had split into factions and begun to attack one another.</p>

  <p class="text">By July 1968, Mao had reached the goal of eradicating his political enemies, with Liu Shaoqi being snatched by the Red Guards without any legal or administrative procedures and dying in prison a year later. Worried about losing control, Mao finally called for an end to the Red Guards’ terror. He then called the Red Guards to go to the countryside, calling it poetically the biggest classroom for students, where they would fly high and realize their dreams. This marked the beginning of the second stage of the Cultural Revolution. The years of the Cultural Revolution eventually created so much social chaos and discontent that it abruptly ended, less than one month after Mao’s death, when his wife, Jiang Quing, was imprisoned.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">When Mao died in </span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">1976</span>, the era of Deng Xiaoping began. Although Deng Xiaoping was never officially named general secretary of the Communist Party or president of China, his power <span aria-label="43" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43" role="doc-pagebreak"/>was pervasive, and he was considered the country’s paramount leader from 1978 until his resignation in 1989. However, the Deng Xiaoping era stretched beyond Deng’s own rule and into the terms of his predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, as Deng’s policies and philosophies continued to have a deep effect on the country.</p>

  <p class="text">As an extremely pragmatic person, when he first came into power, Deng Xiaoping knew that Mao was still widely beloved. Thus, to denounce Mao would have been unwise and politically divisive. At the same time, the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward still evoked unpleasant memories among many people. To walk the fine line of public opinion, as soon as he assumed power in 1981, Deng Xiaoping enacted an official report of the Communist Party titled <span class="italic">The Official Verdict on Major Historical Events of the Communist Party</span>. In it, he stated that the Cultural Revolution had been a complete mistake by Mao, although Mao had been a great leader prior to that. Deng Xiaoping quickly sought acceptance of this verdict, which contained general principles but was not detailed. This was Deng Xiaoping’s style. He left the details to be figured out by future generations so that the current generation could focus on more pressing issues.</p>

  <p class="text">As early as 1980, reflecting on the painful experience of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping implemented a system of retirement policies in the Communist Party and the government, requiring officials to step down at a certain age. He also implemented sweeping economic reforms known as “reform and opening up,” during which he opened the Chinese economy to the outside world and began to privatize state-­owned industries. Deng’s strategy was to transition China’s economy slowly and methodically, “crossing the river by feeling the stones” and testing new policies gradually in special economic zones. Unlike Mao, Deng was extremely pragmatic, once proclaiming, “I don’t care if the color of the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s guiding concept was extremely simple: The founding mission of the Communist Party is to let people live better and <span aria-label="44" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to make the country more powerful. Thus, all of Deng’s policies aimed toward this end. He hated and avoided ideological debates. I often joke that Deng is the best advertiser of Nike shoes: Just Do It (don’t debate)! In practice, this translated into his call for watching and learning from the success of other countries and for a philosophy in China’s foreign policy called Tao Guang Yang Hui (hide your shine and bide your time)—­in other words, keep a low profile in international relations.</p>

  <p class="text">While Deng Xiaoping was a pragmatic Just-­Do-­It leader, under his guidance the party had a major ideological shift. This happened in the early 2000s when Jiang Zemin was general secretary of the party. Until then, according to classical Marxism, the Communist Party was to be the vanguard to overthrow the capitalist system. Instead, Jiang stated that the Communist Party should represent three elements—­this is known as the Three Represents Theory. First, the party represents the progressive direction of economic development. Second, the party represents the progressive culture. Third, the party represents the progressive direction of social change. Under the Three Represents Theory, the Communist Party aims to become a party of elites and is not too far removed from the ideology of a social democratic party in Western Europe.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The party has officially </span>claimed it is now in a new era, which began in November 2012 when Xi Jinping formally became president and general secretary of the Communist Party. Xi’s guiding principle is not to forget the founding mission of the Communist Party, which, as laid out in Xi’s documents and speeches, espouses his goal of leading China’s revival. The single most impor­tant tenet of Xi Jinping’s leadership philosophy is that the party has to be on top of everything, and in order for the party to perform this role well, the discipline within the party should be strengthened, including a strict anticorruption protocol. In <span aria-label="45" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the previous Deng era, there were many discussions and cases of reforming Chinese politics by separating the party from the government, that is, for the party to reduce its control of the government and for the government to become more democratic and independent of party operations. For example, in the Deng era, there were many cases of having open elections of mayors of cities with multiple candidates for each position. On several occasions, the party’s most favored candidates failed to be elected.</p>

  <p class="text">Mao, Deng, and Xi represent three very different styles of leadership. Mao was complex as a person and a leader. In a letter to his wife in 1966, just when he was waging the Cultural Revolution, he described himself as a monkey and a tiger in one body. That is, he was rebellious, self-­doubting, and restless like a monkey and yet very pragmatic and confident like a tiger when fighting his enemies. He wanted to be worshipped and yet he was sarcastic about his personal cult, telling Edgar Snow, a trusted American journalist, that being saluted as a king was like being baked on a grill. He could be ruthless as a world-­class strategist and yet, very different from other dictators, he never believed in political assassination. His ultimate goal was to make his enemy get down on their knees and say: I was wrong and you are right. He was held to be an ingenious leader for plotting and implementing strategies that helped the Communist Party assume national power. However, his vision for a modern China based on a state-­controlled economy and egalitarian principles fared poorly with not only his colleagues but also ordinary citizens. Most interestingly, he sensed his failure a few years before his death and tried to reverse it by various means. He fared miserably in this. He was like an aging superstar in basketball, refusing to sit on the bench after missing many shots and stubbornly shooting another long-­distance air ball while the fans were politely cheering. Truly a tragedy.</p>

  <p class="text">Deng was almost the opposite of Mao. He was short in stature and equally short in his speeches. He was often surprisingly <span aria-label="46" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" role="doc-pagebreak"/>brief and honest when speaking. Deng said: “Being poor is not socialism. Let us get rich first before worrying about other things because otherwise we will be wiped off the earth by the powerful.” He was also credited for saying: “To get rich, make friends with the US.” It is fun to read Deng’s <span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, which contains many articles only as long as a few hundred words. Deng knew the problems of the latter-­day Mao all too well and chose to phase out of politics while he was still active, like a sports star just after a year of peak performance.</p>

  <p class="text">Xi is very different from Mao and Deng. When Xi walks into a room, you can see he is a serious, calm, respectful man. He is down to earth, hardworking, and mindful of details. In a small meeting I attended, Xi said, “I want to taste the steamed bun myself, I don’t want other people to chew it for me.” He meant that he wanted to have firsthand knowledge as much as possible. I have also heard him talking about keeping tabs on popular topics on social media to have a greater connection to the people and the issues that matter to them.</p>

  <p class="text">Xi’s rise to China’s top political position came by perseverance. When Xi was nine years old, his father, a deputy premier (Zhou Enlai was the premier), was put in jail under suspicion of having sponsored a novel hinting that Mao and the party were saved by his faction at the end of the Long March. During the Cultural Revolution, when Xi Jinping was sixteen, he was sent to the countryside. He spent years enduring extreme hardships in a poor village. Xi recalled during a TV interview that he was constantly hungry during this time. He later emerged as a leader of the village, helping villagers to harness new technologies such as using biogas for fuel instead of burning corn husks. In the era of Deng, his father was rehabilitated, and Xi joined the government, working up from low-­level positions all the way to being the top leader of a few provinces. His first wife sought to divorce him, wanting to emigrate to the UK. For one year, every week, he would make phone calls to the UK to persuade her to come back. Despite his <span aria-label="47" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47" role="doc-pagebreak"/>family background, on several occasions, he ran into dead ends in his political career, since his immediate supervising official had prejudice against him. He had to uphold himself and looked for help from other sources.</p>

  <p class="text">As a loyal son of his revolutionary parents and the party, Xi faces a few fundamental challenges that his predecessors never encountered. The obvious one is that China is now perceived as a big threat to the West, as is discussed in many parts of this book. Xi is a believer in direct communications with top foreign leaders and has tried to make friends with Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, and Donald Trump. Donald Trump, despite his aggressive stance against China, has always referred to Xi as his friend. Perhaps more significant than the challenge from the West is the domestic one. Xi has a vision for a modern China with orderly governance by an ethical and effective Community Party. He personally hates corrupt and dishonest government officials, calling them the trash of society. As an upright leader and tough fighter against corruption, he is regarded as a savior of the party and Chinese military, which suffered badly from the problem of venality. But he faces a challenge from changes in the Chinese population. The population is becoming increasingly prosperous and well educated, with over 50 percent of young people attending college. Also, as of 2022, the middle-­income group is now four hundred million, about one-­quarter of the population. The increasingly well-­educated and economically well-­off segment of the population tends to be more argumentative and expressive than their poor and uneducated parents. It is a challenge for Xi to communicate and respond effectively to the increasingly segmented society. Obviously, no Chinese leaders confronted such an issue until now.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The Chinese Communist Party </span>is easily the world’s largest and most powerful political party, having ruled the <span aria-label="48" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak"/>world’s largest country for over seventy years and boasting almost one hundred million members.</p>

  <p class="text">People usually join the party when they are young. In order to join the party, a person must submit an application, including a personal statement and recommendations from party members. A branch committee consisting of three to twenty members then vote on the application, and if they decide to approve it, the applicant enters a one-­year probation period before becoming a full member.</p>

  <p class="text">When seeking to expand its membership, the party focuses on two main groups. The first category is college students, young professionals, and other well-­educated people who will likely grow up to work for the government in some capacity. The second category is composed of grassroots-­level party members, who are usually manual workers or peasants. There is a general plan as to how many new party members to recruit. In recent years, a larger quota has been assigned to the recruitment of grassroots party members because they are regarded as vital to maintaining the party’s governing stability. For example, every village has a party committee that often overlaps with the village committee of governance. Thus, many local governance issues, ranging from poverty reduction to garbage collection, go through the party committee at the grassroots level. The party committee of the village is even more impor­tant than the city council of a small township in the United States, since top-­down policies are implemented by the party committee.</p>

  <p class="text">Why do young people choose to join the party? The answer is actually quite simple: because the party manages personnel decisions. To become a government official, it is almost essential to join the party. To make a simple comparison, college graduates in the United States wishing to enter public service often attend law school first. The list of notable figures who have taken this path includes Presidents Clinton and Obama. <span aria-label="49" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In China, young people aspiring to careers in public service will join the party instead.</p>

  <p class="text">The party has an organizational presence at virtually every level in every aspect of society. Every village has a party committee, every department of a university has a party branch, and even factories have a party branch. The more impor­tant an organization is, the higher its party branch is ranked. These party branches typically make two types of decisions. The first takes place mostly in party committees of provinces or cities and is by far the most impor­tant: personnel decisions. For example, the party committee of a province is headed by the province’s party secretary, who is the province’s top official, followed by the governor. The provincial party committee makes the nomination decisions for all municipal-­level mayoral candidates (who will later be officially elected by the corresponding people’s congress) and party secretaries in the province. By the time the party committee votes on each personnel decision, the organization department (essentially the human resources department of the party) will have already done a significant amount of background research on the various candidates.</p>

  <p class="text">Party branches can also be involved in personnel decisions outside of the government. For example, the party branch of a university is heavily involved in the process of choosing a new dean of a school of the university. The party branch will first conduct surveys among professors and students to select candidates, and then gather opinions on the candidates from key staff members and professors. Eventually, the party branch will meet to make a selection, and will then post the decision on its website for seven days to allow for public comments. If seven days pass without any major valid complaints, the decision will be finalized.</p>

  <p class="text">The second type of decision made by party committees concerns major operations of local governments, universities, or ministries. For example, the target of economic growth for a city in the coming year will first be discussed in the municipal party committee before becoming a more detailed policy plan in the <span aria-label="50" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50" role="doc-pagebreak"/>city government. Party committees and branches are also tasked with ensuring that government policies are successfully implemented on the local level. This was the case during COVID-­19, when local party committees played a significant role in disseminating public health information and ensuring that quarantines and mask requirements were respected. In another example, when the Chinese government was working to eliminate absolute poverty between 2018 and 2020, each village’s party committee was in charge of making sure that government subsidies and policies for the poor were being implemented in their area. The work of party committees was one of the key mechanisms in poverty reduction.</p>

  <p class="text">In the era of Xi Jinping, there have been reforms to beef up party operations. For example, the party has publicized a series of regulations regarding how party committees should be organized, how decisions should be made, and how members should be recruited. These elements are called “party construction.” For example, one of these regulations requires party committee members to hold regular meetings called democratic life meetings, during which they analyze their actions and areas for improvement through self-­inspection and self-­criticism.</p>

  <p class="text">It is interesting to compare the Chinese Communist Party’s practice of promotion with analogous practices in the United States or the West in general. The Chinese approach places emphasis on long-­term evaluation and accumulation of experience through step-­by-­step hierarchical promotions in addition to qualifications and meritocracy. What is good about this practice is that by the time individuals are finally promoted to senior official positions, they possess extensive work experience. For example, before he was named the national leader of China, Xi Jinping was the leader of a provincial-­level city, Shanghai, and before that he was the leader of one of the most economically impor­tant provinces in China, Zhejiang. Even earlier, he was the head of Xiamen and Fuzhou, cities at the forefront of China’s “opening up.” <span aria-label="51" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Before Xiamen and Fuzhou, he was a county mayor in an agricultural county near Beijing. Thus, Xi Jinping carries with him to the presidential office substantial experience as a government official at multiple levels. This is striking in comparison to, for example, President Trump, who had never served a day in public office in his life prior to his inauguration. One may argue that a leader like President Trump carries great momentum for implementing change since he is not versed in the existing practices. However, for an extraordinarily large country like China, the cost of sudden changes can be very high.</p>

  <p class="text">The drawback to the Chinese step-­by-­step approach to selecting party and government officials is that candidates often lose their “genius” or impetus to conceive new ideas once they move up within the hierarchy. As such, China’s foreign policy community has never seen and will never see the emergence of a figure like Henry Kissinger, who totally changed the strategic thinking regarding American foreign policy. In China, it would also be unimaginable to have a forty-­something-­year-­old leader such as David Cameron and Tony Blair of the UK, or US presidents John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. This is why drastic policy changes in China are difficult to achieve. From this perspective, one appreciates even more the monumental events of Mao’s death and Deng’s ascendance after the Cultural Revolution. Deng was a truly new leader and completely different from his predecessor, yet he was vastly experienced in Chinese domestic affairs and uniquely positioned to make drastic changes.</p>

  <p class="text">When the party faces a true crisis such as the military failures of the Long March or the widespread discontent following the Cultural Revolution, the party will usually elect a new leader. In the case of the Long March, Mao Zedong fought hard to win the leadership role, and in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping did the same. A top leadership change <span aria-label="52" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is the primary mechanism historically used by the Communist Party to implement drastic policy shifts in response to massive crises. In other situations, the party gravitates toward gradual policy changes according to feedback regarding the policies already in place.</p>

  <p class="text">The topic of the Chinese Communist Party is too impor­tant to be explained in just one chapter. Thus, in the next chapters, I explain how the party governs the country through the operations of the central government and local governments, and how the party strives to fight corruption. All together, these chapters provide a full picture of how the huge country of China is governed.</p>
