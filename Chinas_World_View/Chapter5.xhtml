  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_5"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter5"><span class="running-head">Local Governments</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hinese local government officials are very different from their Western counterparts in three respects. First, they have a much wider scope of operations, behaving like parents of local residents. Second, they act as the CEO of the local economy. Third, they need to interact closely with higher-­level officials, and they compete against their peers for promotions that are decided by higher officials. In general, they are often very autonomous and active, as they are “far away from the emperor.” I explain these three things in this chapter.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The simplest and best </span>Chinese phrase explaining the relationship between the Chinese people and local governments is that local officials are like “parent-­officials.” That is, they closely manage issues of their local residents. These officials are not elected, but are appointed by their superiors, who are like grandparents. Thus, local officials have no need for election campaigns—­instead, they compete among their peers to be promoted by the grandparent officials. For better or for worse, this has been the Chinese tradition for thousands of years. For the local residents, there is almost an implicit contract with local officials: <span class="italic">You take care of my problems, and in exchange, I accept some of </span><span class="no-break-italic">your intrusions.</span></p>

  <p class="text">What do the local officials do in their role as parents of local <span aria-label="70" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" role="doc-pagebreak"/>residents? They plan for local social and economic development, relocate occupants of land to make room for development, guide the operation of schools, build new roads and railway stations, guard against traffic accidents, and in some cases even organize events like pop concerts or international forums to boost their city’s publicity. Impor­tantly, they also make sure there are no widespread protests due to conflicts between business owners and workers. When such conflicts arise, either the party secretary of the city or the mayor is usually the first one to mitigate them. Just as children may blame many problems on their parents, local citizens blame many of their problems on the local government. For example, in China, pensioners and elderly people often make bad financial investment decisions which cause them to lose money. As a result, it is not uncommon for them to organize a protest at the door of a government complex. The government then has to find a way to appease these people, sometimes even going so far as to force the financial institutions to return the investors’ money. In extreme cases, the government itself has to provide compensation.</p>

  <p class="text">To provide another example, when inflation was at peak levels in 1994, the central government tasked provincial governors and mayors with the challenge of stabilizing local prices. During that time, it was said that mayors and governors were “caretakers of the vegetable baskets” of local residents. Each province was responsible for ensuring there would be a sufficient supply of vegetables at a reasonably low price. In 2012, pork prices doubled within the span of a few months due to farmers’ miscalculations based on the extremely low prices in the previous year, which prompted them to eliminate many female pigs. The central governments then issued mandates to local governments to subsidize pork farmers, ensuring that pigs would reproduce as quickly as possible. At that time, families of single children were also subsidized for following the government’s one-­child population policy. A joke quickly spread on China’s internet: In order to receive the <span aria-label="71" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71" role="doc-pagebreak"/>most government subsidies, it is much better to have many female pigs than a single child.</p>

  <p class="text">With greater involvement in their constituents’ affairs also comes more power for Chinese local governments and their officials. Local governments in China consist of the administrative, legislative, and judicial branches. In the United States, these branches are separate, forming checks and balances, but in China, all three are under the authority of the party leader. This is a key point to keep in mind as we explore the topic of local governments, although it is true that political reforms in China are increasingly calling for more independent local courts. In addition to the three branches, the local government also has tremendous control over local media: Senior executives in the local media are appointed and are overseen by the local government. This is akin to New York City mayor Bill de Blasio’s having the power to appoint the editor-­in-­chief of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> or at least the <span class="italic">New </span><span class="italic">York Post</span>.</p>

  <p class="text">On a darker note, the huge concentration of power in the hands of local officials helps to explain corruption at the local level. As a result, a recent reform was implemented calling for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to supervise subordinate agencies, rather than for the Discipline Inspection Commission of a province to supervise the officials of the same province.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Perhaps the best way </span>to understand local Chinese officials is to spend a day in their shoes. This is exactly what students at Tsinghua University’s Schwarzman College do in a mini-­course called a “deep dive.” They have found it extremely revealing.</p>

  <p class="text">Let us meet Mr. Chen, former party secretary of a top-­five city in China.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter5.xhtml#footnote-001">2</a></span></span> An eloquent and handsome man, quick to the point, his speech peppered with metaphors and famous quotes, he was a charismatic leader.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="72" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To be fair, Mr. Chen has done a great job transforming his city. Historically, his city has been regarded as a “sleepy” city where people used to leisurely chat the day away in the city’s famous teahouses. Now, under Mr. Chen, it has become one of the most glamorous cities in China for great food, good taste in consumption, and leisurely living. Mr. Chen himself was not a native of the area—­he is from northern China where people are known to be more expressive, eloquent, and aggressive. In an effort to avoid nepotism, in Chinese politics, a city’s leader is usually not from the area. This has been the practice for thousands of years, ever since the first emperors ruled China.</p>

  <p class="text">In 2010, a typical day for Mr. Chen went something like this: In the morning, after finishing breakfast, he would be briefed on national and international news by his assistant, who is a young man. In China, government officials are usually not allowed to have assistants of a different gender. One particular morning, he asked specifically how the internet was reacting to his speech the day before, in which he had tried to jumpstart the rebranding of his city from one of leisure to one of hard work. Mr. Chen proposed that the city be rebranded as a city of “can do” or the “city of success.” His assistant responded that most netizens were enthusiastic about his proposal, although some were sarcastic, saying that the nature of a city cannot be changed by a party secretary. In all likelihood, the overly negative comments were probably deleted by his office.</p>

  <p class="text">At 8 a.m., Mr. Chen held his twice-­a-­week meeting with the Standing Committee of the city’s branch of the Communist Party. Each of these meetings was attended by nine people, including the mayor and other officials responsible for the city’s most critical decisions. Mr. Chen would invite various experts to present reports to the Standing Committee, solicit the views of his fellow members, and present his summary at the end. He was very effective at gathering opinions from his colleagues and encouraging them to speak up. At this particular meeting, the participants <span aria-label="73" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" role="doc-pagebreak"/>discussed plans to further attract investments to the city and take advantage of the global financial crisis, which they compared to a curve on a racetrack where many cars slow down. As a result, they agreed that this was the best chance for his city to surpass other cities.</p>

  <p class="text">Throughout the day, Mr. Chen would have his team frequently monitor the internet to keep their finger on the pulse of public reactions to his policies, sometimes even gathering information from journalists. This is a common practice among all effective local government officials, as is censoring the most personal attacks. For example, when Chen built an exhibition center in the city, people criticized the move, saying it was a waste of money and the city would never recoup the expenditure. In response, Mr. Chen privatized the exhibition center by allowing a private company to run it—­a rare practice among Chinese cities. Now, the exhibition center is one of the few profitable ones and serves as a model for other cities.</p>

  <p class="text">At 10:30, Party Secretary Chen rushed to another part of the city to attend an impor­tant ceremony for a new construction project. A major multinational automobile producer was investing in a new production facility in the city, where it would eventually produce two hundred thousand family cars per year. Mr. Chen successfully wooed the company after many visits to the headquarters of the car maker, and he also coordinated with the central government officials in the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which is in charge of approving huge projects of this nature in order to avoid excessive and repetitive industrial investments. One main obstacle still stood in the way—­a few families were refusing to relocate to make room for the factory. Mr. Chen issued instructions that the families should be treated considerately, and that officials should persuade them to move by talking to their relatives and by increasing their compensation. Mr. Chen also emphasized that the compensation amount should be kept secret from the media because otherwise, <span aria-label="74" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it would encourage other households to hold out for more money in the future.</p>

  <p class="text">After lunch, Party Secretary Chen attended the meeting of the Communist Party’s Legal Affairs Committee, where a few thorny issues emerged. The son of a former deputy mayor was involved in a property development company that had physically injured a local resident who had asked for an extremely high amount of compensation to vacate a building that was to be torn down and rebuilt. Mr. Chen listened carefully to the details and considerations of the case. Finally, he decided to change the case from a criminal case to a civil case and settle the matter outside the court in order to minimize social impact. He worried that if the case were to go to an open trial, many local residents would believe most or all developers to have close government connections, damaging public relations. In settling the case, Mr. Chen stipulated that substantial compensation should be given to the plaintiff, and efforts should be made to ensure the plaintiff’s silence. Indeed, Mr. Chen was not only the leader of political affairs, he was also the leader of the legal system.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Chen had dinner at an event attended by a few philanthropists from abroad, some of the wealthiest investors in China, and influential scholars. The dinner was followed by an academic and policy forum with the theme of environmental protection and building up western China, where his city is situated. As the first speaker at the forum, Mr. Chen knew that this was not the time for him to be outspoken, as any verbal slips would be caught and amplified by the media and scholars in attendance. He opened the forum by welcoming participants to the “city of success,” and then said, “I will stick to my long-­time principle that when I meet scholars, I do not speak, I listen. In front of you, I am a pupil; I am learning.” When the forum ended, he shook hands with all the scholars and thanked them for their insights. It was now 10 p.m., and the end of a typical day in 2010 for Mr. Chen as the party secretary of an impor­tant and rising city.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="75" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As a capable and savvy official, Mr. Chen was familiar enough with Chinese politics to know that superb job performance would not be enough to secure a promotion—­he had to be associated with the right camp. Unfortunately for Mr. Chen, he was a protégé of the former party secretary of the province, of which his city is the capital (a relationship akin to that between the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City, with the major difference being that in China, the governor appoints the mayor). Mr. Chen’s mentor was later sentenced to life in prison for having taken huge bribes in exchange for arranging the promotions of party and government officials.</p>

  <p class="text">Sadly, Mr. Chen is also now in prison. He was alleged to have bribed his mentor and his friends in order to advance his career, and he confessed to these crimes. From prison, Mr. Chen gave a very sincere and tear-­jerking interview during which he expressed remorse for his corrupt behavior and admonished other government officials to remain firmly rooted in their moral principles. The interview became a masterpiece within the educational materials of the anticorruption campaign, which started in 2012 under Xi Jinping and is discussed in the next chapter. The story of Mr. Chen was exalted as a cautionary tale.</p>

  <p class="text">Two details may interest you. First, are most local officials men? The answer depends on the rank. The higher the rank, the higher the percentage of men. One of the reasons is that these jobs require extremely long hours, and educated Chinese women traditionally choose professional careers such as becoming doctors, accountants, and lawyers. In recent decades, there have been explicit policies, similar to affirmative action in the United States, designed to increase the percentage of women among senior government officials.</p>

  <p class="text">Second, what is life in prison like for formerly senior officials like Mr. Chen? I explored this issue with an official in charge of prisons. The answer: salubrious. Food, creature comforts, reading, TV time, and family visits are generously available. No <span aria-label="76" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76" role="doc-pagebreak"/>banquets, no drinking, and a strict schedule mean that those in prison become healthier than before. In one case, a convicted official refused to apply for reduced time, saying that staying inside provided an easier life than being outside.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Instead of waging open </span>campaigns for career promotion, ambitious local officials compete with peer cities or regions for recognition from their superiors. Continuing to reference the example of Mr. Chen (prior to his conviction), let’s have a closer look at the competition for promotion among local officials. The primary scoring criteria in this “tournament” are social and economic performance. In Mr. Chen’s case, he was appointed by the Communist Party Organization Department of his province. The residents in his city did not have a direct say in his selection, but officials from the Organization Department did speak with local residents and gather information on Mr. Chen before making their decision. Overwhelmingly good views from the residents do not matter, but sharp complaints from key groups (such as retired officials or key opinion leaders) will lead to further investigations and may ruin a promotion.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Chen’s city is often compared with a coastal city in Shandong province and a star city in Yunnan province. As such, the party secretaries of these cities are all candidates to become governor of a major province. As the party secretary of his city, Mr. Chen needed to satisfy three criteria in order to compete seriously with his peers and improve his chances for promotion.</p>

  <p class="text">The first criterion is economic growth. If an official such as Mr. Chen is successful in promoting economic development, he will most likely either be promoted to the next rank or sent to another, more impor­tant region. When Mr. Chen worked in Liaoning, and later in his current city, his region’s economies achieved higher economic growth rates, greater tax revenue growth rates, and more foreign investment than peer cities. His success drew the <span aria-label="77" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77" role="doc-pagebreak"/>attention of higher-­level party officials, setting him apart from his peers and making him an appealing choice for promotion.</p>

  <p class="text">The second criterion is to enact noteworthy initiatives and improvements. One of Chen’s initiatives was to implement integrated development of urban and rural areas, in which farmers were recognized as residents of the city and there was no difference between rural and urban residency. Farmers were welcomed to move to cities, buy houses, and send their children to urban centers. This was a pioneering movement in Chinese cities.</p>

  <p class="text">The third criterion is to prevent any major incidents. For example, Mr. Chen had to avert any mass protests in front of the party secretary’s office and ensure that no more than five people from his city made grievance cases to the Ministry of Civil Affairs in Beijing against policies in his city. The grievance process is often a way for local residents to voice complaints about local governance. In Chinese history, appealing grievances to higher levels of government, rather than bringing lawsuits, was a means for ordinary people to seek justice against local officials.</p>

  <p class="text">When a “troublemaker” goes to Beijing to present a letter of grievance in front of a central government agency, that person is quickly detained and investigated to determine which region the person is from. This is part of the so-­called social stability maintenance system. During high-­profile events such as the National People’s Congress meetings in March, the Olympic Games, or national celebrations, every local government is responsible for preventing any local troublemakers from coming to Beijing.<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>Police from local regions usually have already been stationed in Beijing and will drive the troublemaker home in a hired car. This does not mean that local officials should silence all protests, but they take care not to disrupt impor­tant events in the capital.</p>

  <p class="text">If Mr. Chen had satisfied all three of these criteria—­spurring economic growth, enacting noteworthy initiatives, and preventing troublemakers from going to Beijing—­plus having zero <span aria-label="78" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78" role="doc-pagebreak"/>strong complaints from key subgroups of local residents, his next promotion would probably have been to either the governor of his own province or party secretary of a smaller province. Of the two, party secretary is the more coveted position for the simple reason that the party secretary is the number one official of the region.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Chinese local officials often </span>behave like the CEO of the holding company of all local corporations. This means that they advocate for the interests of local corporations and solve problems for the corporations. Their schedules are brimming with banquets and investment forums, events that help them build relationships with businesses that might invest in their region. In China, a local government official who is promoted must have the spirit of an entrepreneur. What is the spirit of entrepreneurship? To me, the most impor­tant element is the desire and ability to solve problems, identify a market niche, and find a way to bypass existing regulations. Regulations are like laws, and good entrepreneurs in China have to behave like good lawyers, reinterpreting regulations while behaving like a businessperson as they actively search for solutions.</p>

  <p class="text">When I meet local officials, the most common question they have for me is, “Which sector or industry should the local economy develop?” As an example, Guizhou is one of the poorest provinces in China, but its officials argue that it has an abundance of hydraulic power and numerous mountains, so the province can build data-­storage facilities in the mountains as backup centers. Officials also point out that Guizhou is cool in the summer, so companies can save on air conditioning costs. In this case, the officials think like the CEOs of data service companies such as IBM or EMC. When I visit the city of Baotou, the world capital of rare earth deposits, local officials often ask how they can make the best economic use of this valuable resource. My response is that they may consider aggressively promoting the MRI equipment <span aria-label="79" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79" role="doc-pagebreak"/>production business, since MRI machines require the use of magnetic materials, and rare earth elements are a key ingredient in these materials. When I visit the city of Guangzhou, local officials want to know how their city can develop a financial center, since Guangzhou has become a leading manufacturing center for home appliances, motorcycles, tiles for home construction and decoration, and many other items. All in all, Chinese local government officials behave like CEOs of large holding companies with many business lines.</p>

  <p class="text">One consequence of the local Chinese government’s pro-­business and pro-­investment behavior is that since 1992, China has been either the number one or number two destination for foreign direct investment, taking turns with the United States. Foreign direct investments are mostly investments to start new businesses. Although I cannot think of a single company or project that is being wooed by both China and the United States, I do come across many government officials from both countries who are trying to attract businesses to their local regions. In the years before Donald Trump became president, US officials constantly took provincial tours in China to lure Chinese investment to America. In 2006, I met the then-­governor of South Carolina, Republican Mark Sanford, in Beijing. We had dinner together with a few Chinese businesspeople, during which the governor shared that his goal was to attract Chinese investors to his state. When I asked him to tell me the biggest single competitive advantage of his state, he surprised me by saying that power is much cheaper in South Carolina than in China. He impressed me as a very sincere person who did not use the dinner as an opportunity to give his tablemates a lecture on ideological matters. I came away from the evening with the strong impression that at least some US government officials act like their counterparts in China.</p>

  <p class="text">The competition for direct investment explains the puzzle of why Chinese regulations appear extremely complicated <span aria-label="80" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80" role="doc-pagebreak"/>on paper—­making it look almost impossible to do business in China—­and yet deals are finalized rather quickly. Local governments are in a race against each other to help companies, especially multinational companies, bypass these regulations. For example, the central government often requires foreign investors to pay 25 percent in corporate profit tax, but local officials usually promise that in the first two years, the profit tax will be waived, and in the next three years only one-­half of the profit tax has to be paid.</p>

  <p class="text">The intense focus on GDP growth does have bad consequences. Prior to 2012, when Xi Jinping became the party secretary general, many cultural and historical legacies were thrown by the wayside in the name of economic development. In the city of Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, there was once a beautiful train station still standing from the time when Germany controlled the province prior to World War I. The station was a classic structure, built in the European style in the early 1910s, and served as a landmark until the mayor of Jinan ordered its controversial demolition in 1992. He pushed forward despite numerous objections from citizens who wanted to save the historic structure, setting his sights on one singular goal—­economic opportunity. He tore down the station to make room for a huge square that could house a newer, bigger, better station. From a purely economic perspective, the mayor was correct, as it was much easier to entice developers with an empty lot. However, many people in Jinan continue to criticize the mayor to this day for the demolition, mourning the historical treasure that has been lost. This is similar to the time when New York City’s old Penn Station was demolished to make room for Madison Square Garden, but in China, such cases are more frequently observed.</p>

  <p class="text">After coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping pushed to reverse this trend of economic development at the expense of all else. Before becoming the top leader, he had already shown an innate preference for preserving the environment and cultural heritage. In the mid-­1990s, Xi was the head of the city of Fuzhou, Fujian, <span aria-label="81" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and later the entire province of Fujian. At this time, the city of Fuzhou had given Hong Kong business tycoon Li Kaishing the most valuable land in the inner city in the hopes that he would renovate a historic, thousand-­year-­old block called San Fang Qi Xiang (meaning three lanes and seven streets). However, Li carried out a lengthy, ten-­year project to demolish the historic buildings and roads, building skyscrapers in their place. Furthermore, he was known to drag his feet on projects in the hope that China’s quickly rising land prices would result in a higher value for his buildings upon their delayed completion. Under Xi Jinping, the city terminated the contract in protest of these business practices and the disrespect they conveyed for historical and cultural heritage. Later, when Xi was promoted to the head of the province of Zhejiang, he famously said that green mountains and clear rivers are more valuable than gold mountains and silver rivers. Today, with Xi being the top leader, local government officials are evaluated by their efforts in cultural and environmental preservation in addition to local economic performance.</p>

  <p class="text">As a result of the active role played by Chinese governments, central and local, corruption has become a prominent political issue, detrimental to the ruling party’s credibility and legitimacy. Since assuming power in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made it his top priority to clean up corruption, which has had complicated implications for the country. The next chapter is devoted to this complex issue.</p>
