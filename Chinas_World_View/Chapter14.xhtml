  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he very reason you take an interest in this book is likely that you were surprised or alarmed or impressed by the rapid rise of China over the past few decades. But is China headed for a big collapse, making everything you have read irrelevant? In other words, is the rise of China a super bubble that will burst, as was the case with the Soviet Union and Japan? In this chapter, I explain that China is different from the former Soviet Union and Japan, and its rise will most likely continue. There are three reasons for this. First, the market economy has taken root in China. Second, the average income level is still only about 20 percent of that in the United States, and yet the average levels of education and health of the population are not too far away from those in the United States. And third, the political regime does enjoy popular support from the population, if not all of the educated elites.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Moscow is an impressive </span>city by any standard and to me, the most fascinating place is the subway. Many stations are absolutely gorgeous and too splendid artistically to merely be called subway stations; they are more like museums, with beautiful marble domes, paintings, and sculptures, each station in the town center being unique in style. In comparison, New York subway stations are grimy and run-­down, often in various stages of <span aria-label="181" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181" role="doc-pagebreak"/>disrepair. During my first visit to Moscow, I asked my Russian host to take me and my Chinese colleagues on a subway tour, and I still vividly recall being stunned by the elegance.</p>

  <p class="text">The Moscow subway, built in 1933, was a symbol of the Soviet Union’s triumph over the capitalist West; the Soviet economy was growing vigorously and was positioned to overtake the West. Indeed, it was during the Great Depression that the Soviet Union experienced its extraordinarily rapid economic emergence, and many economists wrote that central planning was not only working but superior to a market economy. This was the period when some economists from Austria began to establish their careers by claiming that the Soviet system was doomed to fail.</p>

  <p class="text">An even more potent symbolic Soviet achievement was Sputnik, the first manmade satellite. When it was successfully launched in 1957, the entire Western world was shocked and embarrassed. After all, the United States was supposed to be the leader in science and technology, yet it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite and later sent the first human into orbit. Wasn’t this clear evidence of the Soviets’ economic and political superiority?</p>

  <p class="text">Yet, by 1992, the Soviet Union had collapsed. The faltering Soviet economy simply could not support its expansive military empire. Long before the collapse, the Soviet economy had shown clear signs of fatigue. The best days of the economy in the 1930s were long gone. Although the debate over the Soviet Union’s central planning and free-­market economy was long settled by the late 1980s, very few, if any, experts studying the Soviet system were predicting the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union and its entire Eastern European bloc.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">In the late 1980s, </span>there were unmistakable signs of “Japan as No. 1,” the title of a popular book by the late Harvard sociologist Ezra Vogel. The most visible signs were the ubiquitous electronics such as the Walkman and the extremely reliable, <span aria-label="182" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fuel-­efficient automobiles made in Japan. They were so superior in reliability, functionality, and design that American consumers were willing to pay even higher prices when the Japanese were forced to restrict their exports to the United States (the so-­called voluntary export restriction plan, or VER).</p>

  <p class="text">Yet just a decade after the feared Japan as No. 1, Japanese asset prices began to plunge and this led to decades of slow economic growth. Within three months, from January 7 to April 1, 1990, the stock index dropped by 22 percent, from 37,517 to 29,279. By early 2023, thirty-­three years later, when the United States and many European stock markets had set many new record highs, the Japanese stock price still hovered significantly below 30,000. The drastic fall in asset prices pushed many Japanese companies into delinquency. Businesses shrank. Between 1990 and 2019, the Japanese average annual growth rate was just around 1 percent.</p>

  <p class="text">While everyone spoke of the threat to the United States posed by Japan’s economic emergence in the late 1980s, very few people realized that a devastating collapse of the Japanese housing and financial markets was imminent. And even fewer people predicted that in the following twenty-­plus years, the Japanese economy would either shrink or grow at a rate not even one-­half of that of the US economy.</p>

  <p class="text">Although many people claim that Japan is more livable now with fewer traffic jams, lower housing prices, and less congested streets, it is an undeniable fact that Japan did not become the threat to the United States that people feared in the 1990s.</p>

  <p class="text">Both the Soviet Union and Japan were formidable economic forces in their times and collapsed in dramatic fashion. Both cases illustrate how cataclysmic social events can occur quite quickly, and experts and social scientists have a very poor record in predicting “bubble” collapses. This leads us to the key questions of this chapter: Is today’s China another 1980s Japan or 1930s Soviet Union? Is the Chinese economy headed for collapse the same way that those economies were? Is China a “super bubble” waiting to burst?</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="183" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_183" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The Chinese economy is indeed facing substantial challenges. The GDP growth rate in 2010 was 11 percent. Since then, it has been steadily declining, from 11 percent, to 9.7 percent, to 7.8 percent, to 7.4 percent, and finally to 6.1 percent in 2019 just before the COVID-­19 pandemic. This slowdown happened despite several rounds of mini-­stimulus packages implemented by the central government, consisting of measures including relaxing bank loans, moderately increasing fiscal deficits, and pushing for large infrastructure projects, such as high-­speed railways. This slowdown has spurred talk of whether the Chinese economy will replicate the “super bubble” that burst in Japan.</p>

  <p class="text">Despite its economic slowdown, the first and most fundamental reason why China is not the former Soviet Union is that the Chinese economy is mostly market-­based, dominated by private enterprises, and substantially more dynamic and innovative than the Soviet Union’s. Over 70 percent of the Chinese economy by output and 90 percent by employment is private and market-­based, while almost 100 percent of the former Soviet economy was state-­owned and government-­controlled. Thus, the Chinese economy is much better equipped to respond to the market and provide proper incentives.</p>

  <p class="text">Take the example of Sany Heavy Industry. I happen to know the company and its founders very well. In December 2008, during the global financial crisis, I was invited to Sany to meet the founders. I told them the impending 4 trillion RMB stimulus package would mostly be in infrastructure investment, and Sany would be the first to benefit, so they should speed up and expand their production ASAP! Seven months later, I brought my high school–­age son with me to visit Changsha, where Sany’s headquarters are located. I was curious how they were doing and paid a private visit to their campus. I found that they were operating twenty-­four hours a day, and their leading product was a special machine used to install high-­speed railroads, which they had developed in anticipation of China’s high-­speed rail boom.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="184" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_184" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The reason why Sany was able to respond to the market so effectively and involve itself in R&amp;D so intensely is that it is a publicly listed company founded and run by four schoolmates with a rich history together. The leader and now the largest shareholder is Mr. Liang Wengen, who long dreamed of success and recruited his friends to join him in what would become the wildly successful business venture of Sany. By 2018, Sany, which means “three one” as a nod to Liang and his three classmates, had become a top Fortune 500 firm and a top-­five manufacturer of construction equipment worldwide.</p>

  <p class="text">It might come as a surprise to a non-­Chinese person that Mr. Liang, a private entrepreneur, is a model Communist Party member. He was elected as one of the three thousand delegates to several rounds of the National Congress of the Communist Party. The two roles—­entrepreneur and party member—­do not conflict: Li founded a major company, provided jobs to thousands of people nationwide, and paid hundreds of millions of RMB in taxes. Although he rides in a luxurious car called the Maybach (the former high-­end branch of Mercedes Benz), he works day and night and lives on the company’s campus. The Charter of the Chinese Communist Party does not require that he should give up his shares or his Maybach. Mr. Liang and I meet at least once a year to exchange notes on the macroeconomy. Sany now has manufacturing operations in Africa, India, Germany, and the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">Sany does not stand alone as a non-­state-­owned leader of an economic sector in China. There is Huawei in communications and mobile phones, DJI in the manufacturing of nonmilitary drones, Geely in automobiles, Lenovo in PCs, and more.</p>

  <p class="text">The second reason why China is very different from the Soviet Union is that China’s top decision makers have been extremely cautious or even paranoid about maintaining regime security when it comes to issues of mass grievances. Therefore, the government takes cautious actions to mitigate such issues. This was not the case in the former Soviet Union. In fact, it might be surprising <span aria-label="185" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_185" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to people outside China that mass protests do occur in China, all concerning specific social or economic issues. For example, up to mid-­2018, there were constant and widespread protests by retired soldiers seeking better pensions and other benefits. Thousands of these veterans would suddenly appear at popular tourist sites, extremely well organized. They would line up military-­style, singing military songs, and always strived to remain nonviolent. They would assign a few comrades to record the events on smartphones, especially the episodes where the police resorted to violent force to expel them. Almost all such protests ended up being peacefully dispersed, not only because the government did not want to escalate the situation, but, more impor­tantly, because policy negotiations were in the works to accommodate protestors’ demands. These protests by veterans occurred so frequently that by March 2018, the central government established a new ministry, the Ministry of Veteran Affairs, to deal with the issue. After 2018, protests by retired soldiers had stopped.</p>

  <p class="text">The third reason why China is not the former Soviet Union is too obvious to be mentioned in many discussions. That is, the former Soviet Union was committed to playing the role of a superpower and was managing if not colonizing many parts of the world. It was closely managing the Eastern European bloc and part of the Middle East, and even had influence reaching as far as Cuba. It had a military presence in most of these countries and sent tanks and armies to Prague in Czechoslovakia to crack down on street protests, and to Afghanistan to take over the regime. The USSR was way too overextended in relation to its economic and military capacity. In contrast, China has no overseas military bases in any conventional sense (with the exception of a leased supply base in Djibouti, where many other countries including the United States also have a military presence). China’s Belt and Road Initiative and projects in Africa are in essence economic endeavors of limited scale relative to the size of the Chinese economy (the total outstanding stock of such investments is around <span aria-label="186" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186" role="doc-pagebreak"/>15 percent of the Chinese GDP, while the annual national savings is around 30 percent of GDP). Furthermore, China’s claims of sovereignty over a few dozen islands in the South China Sea would have been regarded as child’s play in the eyes of former Soviet leaders. All in all, China’s geopolitical burden is minimal in comparison with that of the former USSR.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Is China on the </span>path to replicate Japan’s twenty-­plus years of anemic growth? In many ways, China indeed resembles the Japan of the 1990s. Like Japan, China’s consumption ratio as a share of GDP is low, making China dependent on domestic investment and foreign markets to absorb the tremendous amount of savings each year. Like Japan, China’s enterprises have borrowed a huge amount of debt, and China’s property prices are extremely high. In large cities like Beijing, an average person must save twenty years of their salary to purchase a small apartment. Property market prices have risen to such a high level that the total value of property as of the end of 2019 was four times China’s GDP, larger both in ratio and absolute value than that of the US economy. All these factors are similar to those seen in the Japanese economy immediately before its crisis.</p>

  <p class="text">However, today’s China is fundamentally different from Japan in the late 1980s. Firstly and most obviously, China is a much poorer economy than Japan was, and still has space to outgrow its problems. As of 2020, China’s average income was around 20 percent that of the United States, while by the late 1980s Japan had an average income as high as 80 percent of that of the United States. A country with lower income has much more room to grow and can still outgrow many economic problems. (Another argument, with which I partly agree, is that Japan’s economic collapse was a deliberate outcome of US economic policies, and today’s China is much more independent of the US and therefore will not repeat the failure of Japan.)</p>

  <p class="text">An example of how relatively low income translates into rapid growth is urbanization. Only about 60 percent of Chinese people <span aria-label="187" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187" role="doc-pagebreak"/>live in cities, while Japanese urbanization in 1990 was over 75 percent. Rural populations in China have been pouring into cities, becoming wealthy, and beginning to live and consume like typical urban residents. Meet Mrs. Wang, my family’s domestic helper for over ten years. She was a poor farmer who was widowed at a young age, remarried, and later got divorced. She has two sons, and we have paid her above the market rate at around 900 USD a month plus her rent. She used to live in a dormitory in the basement of our residential complex. With little extra living expenses since she eats her meals with us, she has saved so much money that she bought a nice apartment in a city near her hometown for 50,000 USD, around five years of her income. She has extra savings and often asks my advice on investments. She now has retired and remarried and stays at her own apartment in her hometown. She should have easily saved around 20,000 USD in addition to her apartment and still is able to work some odd jobs and continue to live her urban lifestyle.</p>

  <p class="text">There are about three hundred million former farmers like Mrs. Wang. They are the future consumers who will be purchasing and/or renovating apartments. And when they return to their hometowns to live, they will drive up the local economy. Some cities anticipate this and are beefing up their investments in roads, airports, and railroads. When the residents return home, they will buy appliances, furniture, and maybe even their first cars. They personify the forces of growth represented by a formerly poor population and the source of savings of the Chinese economy. This was definitely not the case with Japan in the 1990s, when even farmers were already wealthy.</p>

  <p class="text">The second reason that today’s China is not Japan of the 1990s is the enormity of China’s domestic market. China’s population is about eleven times greater than Japan’s and the labor force about thirteen times larger, due to China’s younger population and higher ratio of labor participation among women. In addition, China’s land area is twenty-­five times greater than Japan’s. All this means that China has the potential to develop a huge domestic market. The poorer western parts of China can trade with the <span aria-label="188" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188" role="doc-pagebreak"/>richer eastern parts just as Japan would trade with Africa, only with much lower logistical costs and trade barriers.</p>

  <p class="text">The property market illustrates why today’s China is different from Japan in the 1980s. China’s high-­priced property has been a top concern about China among many Western observers. However, China is fundamentally different from Japan, and the Chinese property market is unlikely to be a detonating cord for the economy.</p>

  <p class="text">To begin with, as explained, China is still a growing and urbanizing economy. Only 61 percent of the Chinese population was living in cities as of 2020, and furthermore, not all people living in cities are recognized as residents of those cities or own property in the city where they work. Across China, as many as two hundred million people will migrate to cities in the next two decades. This means the demand for urban housing is still growing.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason is that China has been a high savings economy. Chinese households borrow less from banks to buy their apartments than people in other countries. On aggregate, fewer than 50 percent of Chinese housing investments come through bank loans, while in the United States, this number is at least 70–­80 percent. Furthermore, Chinese households have high savings rates—­more than 30 percent of their disposable income. And finally, Chinese households have a strong attachment to their housing. Together, these factors mean that the holding power of families—­in other words, the ability to maintain a property without defaulting—­is categorically much higher in China than in the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">The final and most interesting reason is that there have been enough calls that the wolf is coming that many draconian policies have been put in place to prevent significant price increases in the housing market. In 2012, the central government implemented a policy restricting the purchase of new properties. Under this policy, people without local residency in a city are prohibited from purchasing property there unless they can provide evidence that <span aria-label="189" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they have paid local taxes for the past five years. Additionally, local residents cannot purchase more than two units of property. This policy has proven to be extremely effective in lowering speculative demand for housing, although many free-­market economists are very critical of it.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Today’s China faces two </span>critical social issues that were not faced by the Soviet Union or Japan. The first is huge economic inequality. A significant amount of research shows that China’s income inequality is at least as great as that of the United States, which is among the highest in the developed world. There is a measure of inequity, called the Gini coefficient, which is zero if everyone has the same share of income, and is equal to one if a single person receives all the society’s income. Most economists agree that a Gini coefficient below 0.3 is good, while one approaching 0.4 is dangerous. The US number currently stands at 0.45, but there is no definitive agreement on the Chinese Gini coefficient. Some estimates place the current figure at 0.47, while others place it as high as 0.5. Besides a high Gini coefficient, another clear indication of inequality is the urban/rural disparity. In China, the average income of a rural resident is about 30 percent of that of an urban resident—­one of the largest rural/urban disparities in the world.</p>

  <p class="text">Why might China’s huge economic inequality drag down economic growth? Those who study the Latin American experience would point out that a country with high income inequality can spawn increasing social divisions, causing those with low incomes to fight for policies of redistribution, leading to higher taxes for high-­income groups, and thus diminishing that group’s incentive to work hard. Based on the Latin American example, China will soon find itself in a crisis: For high-­income groups, taxes will be high and incentives low. The free market–­style reforms featuring low tax rates will be reversed.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="190" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In the Chinese case, vast economic inequality is indeed an issue but is perhaps less damaging than in other countries. To begin with, China is unlikely to adopt a political system of popular voting, in which the effects of economic inequality can create the most damage. In this system, low-­income voters, larger in number, would often support populist policies and vote for the candidates who espouse them. If these candidates emerged victorious and their policies were implemented, the financial transfer from high-­income and economically dynamic earners to low-­income earners would drag down the country’s economic dynamism. In China, policy makers are very much aware of these tendencies and potential consequences. I have heard many Chinese government ministers, including a former finance minister and two central bank governors, discuss guarding against such possibilities. Local officials share the same concern. Around 2009, I was invited to attend a consultation meeting with the mayor of Beijing regarding the city’s next five-­year plan. The mayor said something shocking: Beijing is rich enough in public finance to afford making all buses free for everyone. But he added that he would never implement such a policy because it would set a bad example of pleasing the poor at the expense of long-­term public investment, and it would attract an unsustainable number of additional people to Beijing.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason why China’s vast economic inequality is less damaging than in many other countries is that China’s inequality is largely due to regional differences, which are gradually being targeted for improvement by the central government. That is, an individual living in a city in the east is very likely to be far better off than someone living in a rural area in the west. For example, my brother is a retired manual worker in Beijing and my sister is a college-­educated retiree in the western city of Chengdu. My brother is much better off economically than my sister. His pension is easily 50 percent higher than my sister’s, with much better medical benefits, and, as a senior citizen, he receives a free bus <span aria-label="191" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191" role="doc-pagebreak"/>card. The reason for this disparity is that Beijing’s municipal government is much wealthier than Chengdu’s. At our family gatherings, my brother has said many times, with theatrical exaggeration, that he is grateful to the Chinese government and the Communist Party. On the other hand, my sister, being more educated, often complains about government policies. The central government is fully aware of these regional disparities. For decades, there has been a national policy to encourage investors to invest in western and rural areas. In 2000, the ratio between the wealthiest and poorest provinces in per capita income was 4 times; by 2018, it was 3.5. Economic convergence has been occurring all across provinces. Provinces and municipalities have been gradually pooling their pension funds and creating a situation where retirees are increasingly receiving, or will eventually receive, equal pension payments.</p>

  <p class="text">The other critical social problem that today’s China faces is the fast-­growing middle-­income class, which has become increasingly anxious and vocal regarding politics and public policies. The most critical internet postings against the government emanate from this community, which comprises roughly four hundred million people. As discussed before in the chapter on internet and media, the middle-­income group desires more freedom of expression and better access to information, and there will be relevant reforms in the future. Meanwhile, a careful analysis reveals that the middle-­income class is still mostly concerned with specific social and economic issues rather than seeking a change in political regime, since they worry that a regime change would bring huge and unpredictable social turmoil. Their most prominent areas of concern are, in descending order: the intense competition in precollege education, high housing prices, and expensive medical services. Since these concerns do not constitute a desire for or attempts at regime-­changing, the Chinese government should be able to respond by specific reforms.</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="192" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">To summarize what has </span>been discussed above, it is unlikely for China to suddenly collapse like a bursting bubble. There are two reasons for this. The first is that China’s top policy makers are extremely cautious. Among them, there is a constant sense of crisis and urgency. In fact, this sense can even be described as paranoia. Every six months, all agencies through every layer of the government, especially the central government, hold policy consultative meetings. As an economist, I have attended a dozen of these meetings in the past decade, including ones with the president and the premier. The meetings with the president are usually very formal. They begin with the premier giving an overall review of the macroeconomy, followed by each speaker reading from prepared notes, and finally the president providing a summary in which he occasionally refers to the points made by the previous speakers. The president’s summary usually serves as a directive for the policies to be implemented in the coming months. The meetings with the premier are much less formal and intended to be of an advice-­gathering nature. In my experience, Premiers Wen Jiabao and Li Keqiang behave like professors at a university seminar, often intervening in the presentations and arguing with the speakers. The premiers invite not only academic economists to attend, but also business executives and farmers. The invitations often arrive a few days before the meeting so as to provide no preparation time for the speakers, who therefore talk about issues that they care about the most.</p>

  <p class="text">There is a simple rationale behind the intense consultation meetings and frequent field visits organized by China’s top decision makers: Key policy makers are always extremely wary of social and economic problems and are always trying to spot any signs of potential crises and deal with them as early as possible. This is reflected in the language the central government has most frequently used regarding economic policy: “We are entering <span aria-label="193" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the most difficult times for the economy; the economy is non-­sustainable unless we make fundamental changes; the economic transformation is now entering a moment of life-­or-­death and we must make relentless efforts to make the transformation a success.” There is a Chinese saying that the paranoid survive. Chinese policy makers seem to be paranoid, and this is an impor­tant reason why so far they have successfully prevented major financial or economic crises from happening.</p>

  <p class="text">While the key decision makers are extremely cautious or even paranoid, they are also well informed about the external world, especially the West. Vice premier Liu He (in office 2018–­2023) holds a master’s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School. In April 2018, during the intense moments of the China-­US trade dispute, I helped invite five Western and Singaporean opinion makers, including Thomas Friedman of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> and Martin Wolf of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, to visit China in order to understand the Chinese perspectives. They met Vice Premier Liu and to my surprise, the meeting was like an academic seminar totally in English, rather than a formal meeting with interpreters. On the walls of the meeting room were pictures of the vice premier meeting with Dr. Henry Kissinger and other Western statesmen and scholars. The meeting delved deeply into the various issues surrounding the trade dispute, mostly involving US domestic politics. After the foreign guests spoke, the vice premier responded in fluent English. Indeed, the event could have passed for a policy seminar at a US university. Most interestingly, before the meeting, I was invited to his office and surprised to see it littered with the latest issues of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Economist </span>(the UK weekly), and the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>. Apparently, he read them by himself and was highly knowledgeable about how the West perceives China. He is the very person negotiating with President Trump’s trade representatives. Evidently, he had a knowledge advantage over his counterparts. Liu is not the only <span aria-label="194" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194" role="doc-pagebreak"/>member of the cabinet with extensive knowledge of the West. Yi Gang, the governor of the central bank, obtained his PhD in economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and worked as a professor at the University of Indiana for many years before returning to China. I cannot think of any other large countries except South Korea that are similar to China in this regard. Japan, for example, as of 2019, had only one American-­ or Western-­trained top decision maker in the central government: the governor of the Bank of Japan.</p>

  <p class="text">The second reason that China is not a bubble is that it enjoys general although not 100 percent support from its population. Will China’s political regime collapse and therefore bring down the China miracle? The ultimate answer will be given by the relatively young Chinese generation born after the late 1970s and raised in the era of reform and opening up. The popular wisdom is that when a population becomes wealthy enough, their demand for democracy will either foment revolution or a peaceful transition to democracy, and that China will go through this process, in which young people will be the most active agents advancing these changes. People who hold this view refer to the examples of Eastern Europe, as well as South Korea and Taiwan.</p>

  <p class="text">It may come as a surprise that China’s younger generation born in the reform and opening up era (after 1980) may well be willing to support the current political regime for continued economic growth and social stability rather than support an “interruption revolution” like the Arab Spring.</p>

  <p class="text">Eric Li is an example of those in the young generation who are savvy, well educated, and pro-­government in general. He was educated at UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and is an enormously successful venture capitalist and millionaire. He is now a popular political writer in China, authoring articles on <span class="italic">Foreign Affairs</span>, a major US journal, and giving TED talks. His basic point is that American and Western-­style democracy is not the only model for the world, including China, and is not as exemplary as people <span aria-label="195" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195" role="doc-pagebreak"/>believe. The Chinese political and social systems have their own virtues. Li is articulate, forceful, and convincing to many.</p>

  <p class="text">Eric Li represents a young generation of Chinese. They were born in the 1970s, are knowledgeable about the world outside China, and are also the beneficiaries of China’s recent and rapid social/economic development. It is quite interesting to compare these young people with my generation, born in the 1960s. When these young people went abroad to study (and more of them did than those from my generation), they were much more critical of the Western system than we were. Interestingly, there have been studies showing that in recent years, some Chinese exchange students in the United States felt that they were discriminated against, and they turned more supportive of the Chinese government after returning from abroad.</p>

  <p class="text">My generation went to the United States and other Western countries as students at a time when China was “closed.” Everything in the West seemed miraculous to us, and we thought China would never be able to catch up in its social and economic development. We believed that everything in the United States was much better than in China. The current younger generation is much more self-­confident about China for the main reason that they grew up in a rising China, in which they witnessed a drastic improvement in living standards and social order. For example, when I was a child, there was no such thing as queuing in a line when waiting for a bus; people had to fight to get on, with the polite having no chance. Within a decade, this changed, and people are now much more relaxed and patiently queue for a bus. Fundamentally, this is because there are now more buses, and the attitude is, if you miss a bus, the next one is coming in a few minutes, so why fight? The other reason is that the West has had its own problems with issues like rising inequality. In fact, some of my Western academics deplore the degeneration of Western democracy and Western institutions. And it does not help matters that the West has become increasingly hostile toward China, examples <span aria-label="196" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196" role="doc-pagebreak"/>including the chaotic interruptions of the torch relay for the Beijing Olympics in cities like Paris, due to anti-­China demonstrations. People in the West may have long forgotten such incidents, but the younger generation of Chinese keep them deep in their memory, treating them as a sign of the West’s hostility toward a rising China. I am not engaging in a debate about whether this is the case or not, but to be perfectly fair, Western democracy has not been doing a good PR job among the young and educated Chinese population.</p>

  <p class="text">A large proportion of young people I have talked to in China told me that the four years of President Donald Trump in the White House were one of the best illustrations of why China should not adopt the US sociopolitical system. They witnessed the chaotic situation created by the policies and tweets of President Trump. They were turned off by the president’s policy of America First, often bullying less powerful countries and violating international rules. They concluded that if the US sociopolitical system is imported into China, China may become even more chaotic, and this will be disastrous.</p>

  <p class="text">A perhaps oversimplified but informative description of the political spectrum of the educated Chinese is as follows: Many of those born in the 1940s and 1950s harbor extremely positive feelings about the United States and Western politics, since they suffered the most during the Mao era before reform and tend to attribute China’s success to its opening up to the West. Many of those who were born in the late 1970s and later and grew up in the reform era tend to be much more nationalistic and critical of the West and US democracy. My generation, born in the 1960s and early 1970s, stands in the middle.</p>

  <p class="text">Of course, the political views of young and educated Chinese may very well change if the Chinese economy stops growing steadily and potential social problems related to education, medical care, and housing are not mitigated. However, given the pragmatic and cautious nature of China’s policy makers, the current <span aria-label="197" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197" role="doc-pagebreak"/>trend of steady improvement in these areas is likely to continue. This gives me confidence that the political regime is unlikely to be undermined by a revolution waged by frustrated and anxious young people.</p>

  <p class="text">Given that the rise of China is unlikely to be a bubble and that China has been very different from a Western democracy, is China fashioning a new model of social, economic, and political governance, which will potentially be exported to other countries? This is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
