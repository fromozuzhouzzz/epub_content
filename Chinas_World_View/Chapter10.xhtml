  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_10"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter10"><span class="running-head">Education</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ducation is perhaps the single most revealing window to gain an inside look and deeper understanding of Chinese culture and society. Indeed, the state of education provides clues as to a society’s future trajectory of development. In this chapter, I first explain why many, if not most, Chinese families have a religious enthusiasm and anxiety about the education of their children. Meanwhile, exams stand at the center stage of the Chinese education system, aggravating the anxiety of the students and parents. Although major reforms are likely to be implemented in China’s education system, it is probable that the system will continue producing a huge contingent of highly disciplined and skilled laborers. At the same time, highly creative talents will have to be imported from outside or cultivated with international collaboration.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">To many Westerners,</span> Chinese parents seem to have an incredible craze for their children’s education. In fact, the number one priority and anxiety of most middle-­income parents is their children’s school performance. Until recently, on any given weekend, you would find a very crowded scene at the site of any after-­school tutoring center or “cram school.” The business of after-­school tutoring was easily the most prosperous among all service businesses in China. Building after building in cities across the country forced out tenants like restaurants, bakeries, or <span aria-label="139" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stores to accommodate tutoring centers. Economics works here: The tutoring centers were able to pay higher rent than all other businesses, including popular restaurants. This situation got the attention of China’s top decision makers, and so in early 2021, a stern ban was issued on after-­school tutoring, causing tutoring businesses to stall suddenly. However, it is widely believed that underground one-­on-­one tutoring has taken over.</p>

  <p class="text">Why are Chinese parents so crazy about their children’s education? The reason for this is deeply rooted in Confucian doctrine: parents and children are bonded for life. I often joke that in Western countries, children are limited subsidiaries of their parent companies, becoming spin-­offs when they reach independence at age eighteen to twenty. In contrast, Chinese kids are lifetime unlimited subsidiaries of their parents, never spinning off from their parents’ balance sheets. Practically, this means that a successful child is obliged to take care of their parents and grandparents when the parents and grandparents grow older. This is why many Chinese parents believe that their children’s education is the most impor­tant investment a family can make to ensure long-­term prosperity. Poor families know this even better, since a well-­educated child will lift up the whole family economically and socially. Such beliefs are even reflected in the goals of local governments.</p>

  <p class="text">Responding to the concerns for education of local residents, local government officials also take education as one of their key performance indicators. When welcoming a visitor, the mayor of a city may report on the performance of local students in recent years pertaining to their admission rate to either Tsinghua or Peking University. It is almost like the mayor of Detroit, Michigan, talking about how well the local professional sports team has been doing in recent seasons.</p>

  <p class="text">With almost all parents extremely anxious about making investments in their children’s schooling, education has inevitably become a “tournament” with exams as the key battleground. Exams are almost the sole determinant used to sort out students <span aria-label="140" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for admissions to schools of the next level. This is well understood by Chinese parents and schools. The mother of all exams is the set of college entrance exams called the <span class="italic">gaokao.</span> For three and sometimes four straight days in early June each year, over ten million students in China sit for this exam to determine their future. As almost the sole criterion for entry into most Chinese universities, the exams are extremely high-­stakes. In many ways, the <span class="italic">gaokao</span> is treated as the most impor­tant exam of a person’s life.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter10.xhtml#footnote-004">5</a></span></span></p>

  <p class="text">China’s college entrance exams are perhaps the most rigorously organized exams in the world. A few days before the exams, the exam papers are guarded as closely as bankers guard their cash, and satellite tracking is employed to monitor the movement of each box of the exam papers. Occasionally, news surfaces that the contents of the exams were leaked by accident. Whenever this happens, it becomes a nationwide scandal because exams are considered the most sacred and equitable form of competition in China. New exams will be given in such cases. Before the test, all who were involved in designing the exam questions are secluded in a hotel until the exams conclude. After the exam, a large contingent of graders, numbered in the tens of thousands, are also secluded while doing the grading. All answer sheets are supposed to be anonymous. Any answer sheets with a possibility of disclosing the identity of the student would be voided.</p>

  <p class="text">The primacy of exams in China stems from a long historical tradition. For over 1,400 years, China has maintained a history of using written examinations for selecting civil servants. The earliest exams covered literature, history, and nonfiction writing, sometimes concluding with finalists being interviewed by the emperor. Today, some historians praise such a system as meritocratic, as the exams gave any bright and hardworking youngster the chance to become a government official up to the level of the <span aria-label="141" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" role="doc-pagebreak"/>prime minister. Others criticized this exam system for channeling most young talents to serve the emperor rather than pursuing independent academic research and therefore causing China to lag behind the West in science and technology for most of the past five hundred years.</p>

  <p class="text">In the Chinese education system, schools and teachers are also evaluated based on the exam grades of their students. Starting in primary school, each class, typically numbering thirty to fifty students, is assigned a director, the teacher who usually provides instruction in Chinese, math, or occasionally, English. The director is evaluated mainly on the test performance of their class, and thus they typically pay particular attention to top students who are doing well on their class exams and are projected to succeed on the college entrance exams or exams for high school admissions. Therefore, starting at a very young age, children are often subjected to intellectual discrimination: Those who mature early and demonstrate impressive cognitive skills are favored and are often appointed as the leader of the class or head of a subject (such as math); lower-­achieving students are often teased and ostracized by schoolmates or even teachers, since usually these students need the teachers’ extra efforts to improve grades and the teachers would rather help the high achievers. The situation is similar to that in a sports team, in which the coach favors the stars and the supporting cast are not treated as well as the stars.</p>

  <p class="text">In China, the pressure of the college entrance examinations is felt mainly by students from the countryside. For them, a college degree is the only path to a white-­collar job, allowing them to escape the fate of becoming a migrant worker in a big city. In recent years, there has been an emergence of “super schools” in China that essentially “lock up” their students, putting them through drill after drill and treating them almost like medieval monks. These schools are not expensive in comparison with many private (often called international) schools but are selective and tend to enroll hardworking students. The students become <span aria-label="142" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142" role="doc-pagebreak"/>machines programmed to succeed on exams. This process does indeed help students excel on the exams, and the exercise questions used during the test preparation drills have become a sort of Bible for all students in China. As a result, books on test preparation are in great demand.</p>

  <p class="text">One such school is in the city of Hengshui in Hebei province, neighboring Beijing. The school is known for its boarding system in which students are required to go to bed at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m. for exercise. The entire day is spent in classrooms, memorizing facts and undergoing repetitive exam drills. No weekends! No mobile phones! (Except for one day a month.) Students from Hengshui High School consistently produce the highest average test scores in the province, and the champion of the Hebei college entrance exam often comes from Hengshui. Each province has high schools like Hengshui, which are popular for economically disadvantaged students. At one school, the principal holds a ceremony thirty days before the college entrance exams to boost the morale of the students. He has the students line up and then rides past them in a World War II–­style Jeep. Standing in the back seat, he waves to the students as if in a military parade. The students shout “Hooah!” and other military-­style slogans. Indeed, for poor kids, the college exam is akin to war because it determines their fate.</p>

  <p class="text">In contrast, elite schools in large cities, especially provincial capitals, do not often produce the champions of the college entrance exam. Instead, they take pride in preparing students to attend overseas universities such as those in the Ivy League in the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">As one may have guessed, top scorers on the exams may not actually be the best students. Chinese leading universities like Tsinghua and Peking University provide good illustrations of this, as they attract the provincial champions of the college entrance examinations. After excelling on the national college entrance examination, some of these students continue to succeed, but <span aria-label="143" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143" role="doc-pagebreak"/>there are many cases in which the exam champions flunk out after one year due to poor academic performance. This is because unlike in high school, there are no teachers or tutors to push them with drills. In 2010, I came across a student from Peking University wishing to apply to my university’s PhD program. He later failed to be admitted because of a lack of academic potential. But I learned that he had been a college entrance examination “champion” and entered Peking University, only to flunk out because he played too many computer games. One year later, he retook the entrance exam, and again he achieved splendid scores, forcing Peking University to readmit him, as the admissions system only relies on the total score of all exams. This story illustrates that there are special talents in achieving high scores in the Chinese education system, but such talents may not be the same as academic excellence.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason for the decline of top test performers after entering college is that they have studied too hard preparing for the entrance exams and are simply burned out upon entering college. The Chinese society has yet to pay due attention to the phenomenon of burned-­out students. My wife teaches a compulsory course in biology for undergraduates, and each year, among the 250 students in her class, there are always a dozen students who simply refuse to show up for classes or exams. Such students have lost interest in studying and chosen to stay in their dormitories. In such cases, their parents usually would plead for mercy by going after the professor or the student coordinator of the academic school to let their kid pass exams—­recall that I explained how Chinese children are unlimited lifetime subsidiaries of their parents.</p>

  <p class="text">Virtually everyone in China is an expert when it comes to criticizing the ensuing problems of the exam-­centered education system. Why not reform away the exams and follow the US college admissions system, for example? The answer is very simple: Any alternatives will likely involve massive cheating and are much <span aria-label="144" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>worse and less fair. Imagine that instead of written exams, China utilized only recommendation letters and interviews to determine college admissions. Then, personal connections would be prominently involved, and, because economically disadvantaged students lack those connections, they would be greatly disadvantaged. In this regard, I have always found it miraculous that the US system of college admissions is mostly devoid of large-­scale cases of corruption. It relies principally on grades, but reference letters and interviews, which are subject to many types of possible manipulation and interference, are also impor­tant. Yet, in the United States in 2019 there were news reports alleging that some actresses had falsified credentials so that their kids could get into their desired colleges. I am surprised that these cases are seemingly rare, but they still cause a great stir in the national news when they are uncovered.</p>

  <p class="text">Problems with the education system have long been focused on in Chinese society and therefore, various reforms have been implemented. One strand of reform is to dilute the importance of exams. For example, about one hundred prominent high schools have been chosen to let their principals each recommend a dozen students to top Chinese universities. The list of the recommended students is published on the internet in order to be scrutinized by the general public. In order not to be alleged to have been nepotistic, the principals usually choose students who are well-­rounded and have consistently great grades, rather than controversial genius. The latest reform came in March 2021. The Chinese central government issued an urgent and sweeping policy, which was widely guessed to be requested by the office of China’s top leadership, to resolve the problem of too much outside-­class tutoring among primary and high school students. As a result, out of the blue, all the formerly extremely busy and profitable tutoring services were banned. Many such agencies are listed companies in New York, and their share prices drastically declined. Hundreds of thousands of teachers in the tutoring industry lost their jobs. <span aria-label="145" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Of course, many of them switched to private sessions with individual families on the side. Such a reform was no doubt meant well. However, the long-­term impact has yet to be observed and analyzed. Many claim that after the reform, students from high-­income families have benefited since tutoring became much more expensive than before. The root problem is the college entrance exam system, which still prompts students and parents to seek tutoring services.</p>

  <p class="text">Perhaps the biggest impact on the Chinese education system has come from openness to the world. Many Chinese primary schools in large cities, as well as high schools all over China, participate in foreign exchange programs. Through these exchanges, Chinese schools and students increasingly understand that education is more than exams and there are many more things to learn about than just academics. For example, in my daughter’s primary school, many of her classmates had opportunities to visit countries such as Australia, South Korea, the United States, and the UK. Two of her teachers also spent a year in Australia teaching Chinese. In addition, they have had foreign students visit their classes for as long as several weeks. At the college level, Tsinghua University conducts a program that allows undergraduate students to spend one semester in a foreign country, mostly in the United States or Europe. About a third of the students in the School of Economics and Management have taken advantage of these opportunities. In my undergraduate class, which is a required course that I teach in English, out of three hundred students, usually about thirty are exchange students from the United States, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, among other countries.</p>

  <p class="text">The increasing openness of the Chinese education system has provided a stimulus for reform, much to the benefit of students. Schools have begun to introduce new curricula such as critical and moral thinking and to pay more attention to writing and in-­class presentations in addition to written exams as requirements of teaching. One of my former PhD students is a good <span aria-label="146" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146" role="doc-pagebreak"/>illustration. Her home is in a small city in southern China. She attended the International Program of Economics and Law at Nankai University, which is near Beijing and is one of China’s elite universities. Many courses in her program were comparable to those in the West. After leaving the program, she came to Tsinghua, where she worked diligently as a student and earned financial support from the government to spend a year at MIT, whose economics program is one of the best in the world. That one year at MIT helped her tremendously, improving her English language proficiency, and more impor­tantly, expanding her perspectives. After returning to China, she worked as an intern at the World Bank, and following her graduation from Tsinghua, she earned a coveted position with the Economist Program of the International Monetary Fund. The program usually only recruits graduates from top US and UK PhD programs. She was one of the first graduates accepted from a PhD program in China. Her example provides evidence that opening up to the world education system is substantially transforming the capabilities and proficiencies of Chinese students. This gives me confidence that China’s educational system will gradually become capable of regularly producing students who are prepared to succeed in international settings, especially students from China’s elite programs.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">There are many implications </span>of the Chinese education system for the future of China. The first one is relatively lighthearted. Because the future of students is determined by exams, parents usually do not allow their children enough time to play sports unless their kid can become a professional player. Thus, China does well in sports where talents can be easily identified early on. For example, children who become very tall at a young age are persuaded to specialize in basketball or volleyball. Yao Ming, the basketball star, is one example of this. In the sport of diving, China has been very competitive. This is because <span aria-label="147" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the potential for talent can be identified at a young age through various measures like bone size. Once identified as a candidate for athletic success, these kids bypass academics and concentrate on training for their respective sports. Once they are successful, the whole family gets lifted up economically. However, there are sports where talent is latent and takes years of competition to reveal. One of the greatest illustrations of this phenomenon in Chinese sports is soccer. In soccer, unlike diving or basketball, future stars are very difficult to identify at a young age. To a parent, letting their kids play soccer is a lousy investment, as the return is too low in comparison to academic work at school. No wonder the Chinese national soccer team performs so badly in international competitions! The potential future soccer stars are forced to study for their exams, which are a more reliable path to a successful future. I often joke that in China, those beer-­bellied middle-­aged men watching TV broadcasts of Chinese soccer and then complaining bitterly about the performance of the national soccer team should blame themselves, since they would not allow their school-­aged kids to play soccer at the cost of academics. Facing the shortage of domestic stars, the Chinese professional soccer league has been very successful in acquiring the best soccer players from foreign countries, often offering the world’s highest salary.</p>

  <p class="text">On the more serious side, the Chinese education system is adept at producing a large quantity of highly disciplined and well-­trained laborers and knowledge workers such as mobile phone assemblers and computer programmers. For subjects such as math and physics, Chinese primary schools, high schools, and universities subject students to drill after drill. As a result, Chinese students are among the world’s top achievers when it comes to these subjects. According to the mother of the US-­born Chinese Olympian superstar in free skiing, gold medalist Eileen Gu, just ten days of summer training in a Chinese math tutoring program would keep Eileen at the top of her math class in the US high school <span aria-label="148" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for the ensuing academic year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international agency based in Paris, has conducted several rounds of universal tests for high school students in Europe, the United States, China, and beyond. In such tests, Chinese students outperform their peers from other countries by far. There is also another study comparing US workers on the factory floor with their counterparts in China, which found that the Chinese workers are much more skilled at reading and understanding machine manuals than US workers. To me, this is not surprising at all. As a result, China will maintain the advantage of a huge pool of well-­trained and highly disciplined laborers.</p>

  <p class="text">However, there is certainly a downside to the Chinese education system. It is not the most effective in nurturing young students with raw talent into geniuses. At least, the Chinese system is not producing such individuals in a large quantity. Many geniuses like Edison, Einstein, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs have a unique type of intelligence that is not well measured by traditional metrics of academic success. In fact, by such standards they may be completely overlooked! In the Chinese education system, such young talents often cannot survive. They are often scolded by teachers, laughed at by peers, or even discouraged by their parents. The Chinese education system rewards students who succeed based on a rigid academic rubric early on, while a good education system often places tolerance for errors and individual character as top priorities, giving students room to learn from their mistakes and thus fostering creativity. From this perspective, it will take some time for China to be truly a world leader in groundbreaking scientific research, as this requires a good number of geniuses.</p>

  <p class="text">Another implication of the Chinese education system is that China will face a shortage of graduates with international skills. The Chinese education system does not encourage students to express and argue for their views as much as those in the United States or India. Rather, Chinese students are mostly rewarded for <span aria-label="149" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149" role="doc-pagebreak"/>perfecting the skills taught by their teachers, and therefore it is common for Chinese students and young professionals to appear submissive and passive. This is regarded as a merit in Chinese culture for a student or young person. However, in international conferences, multilateral organizations, and multinational corporations, this is a drawback. In these contexts, a young professional is encouraged to respectfully dissent and to express their own ideas. As a result, China faces a shortage of talents who are trained to speak up and play a leadership role outside of China. This is almost the opposite of the Indian situation. Increasingly, many multinational companies and international organizations have top executives born and educated in India, while this has not been the case for Chinese businesspeople.</p>

  <p class="text">From my illustrations and analysis above, it is obvious that education is an intense and hot topic in Chinese society, on the level of racial or gender equity and associated policies in the United States, on which everyone has an opinion and tangible interest. Another socially impor­tant topic is media and the internet, to which I turn in the coming chapter.</p>
