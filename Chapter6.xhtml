  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">C</span>orruption is an impor­tant social topic in China, and in this chapter, I explain several noteworthy things about it. First, in daily life, such as clearing customs at the border, being checked by traffic police, and applying for a passport, China is pretty much free of corruption, and relevant officials are under very tight monitoring. Second, corruption was formerly widespread, mostly in business dealings, and in some cases even in the promotion of government officials. In business dealings, it was an effective means for getting around cumbersome bureaucracy, which is now much less restrictive. Third, fighting corruption has been Xi Jinping’s signature move since assuming power in 2012, and his efforts have been very successful, although there are significant side effects, including shirking and lack of initiative by many government officials.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">For at least two decades,</span> petty corruption, such as bribe solicitation by traffic police or border customs officials, has not been a problem. This is unlike the case in many poorly governed countries, where a police officer may stop a car to check for drunk driving and then accept cash in exchange for not issuing a ticket. Why does this not occur in China? The technical reason is that all on-­duty government officials are closely monitored. All police must carry a video recorder and are heavily scrutinized. Also, <span aria-label="83" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they would face severe discipline if caught engaging in petty corruption. Public locations such as the border control and customs offices have numerous monitoring cameras. A more fundamental reason is that as a growing economy, China has been rich in public finance, and generally speaking, low-­level government officials have been paid well relative to their peers in other vocations. Senior officials of course are paid much lower than business executives, an economic fact sowing the seeds for corruption of higher-­level officials. Another impor­tant fact for China’s relatively untainted low-­ranking police is that in the early 2000s, Zhou Yongkang, as a tough top police officer, implemented an effective anticorruption campaign and cleaned up bad police behavior. Ironically, fifteen years later, he was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment as a highly corrupt official.</p>

  <p class="text">Though there is relatively little low-­level corruption, until 2012, when Xi Jinping assumed power, there had been two forms of severe corruption in China. One was for economic benefits. The other was for political benefits, mostly for those seeking to be promoted, become a delegate to the People’s Congress, or be selected as a member of the CPPCC. In 2011 and 2013, for example, widespread bribery related to selecting provincial leaders and delegates, as well as CPPCC delegates, occurred in Liaoning province. A major investigation into this case was carried out, and many officials were sentenced.</p>

  <p class="text">Economic corruption comes into play mostly because people doing business often have to bypass existing government policies or regulations, many of which have been gradually reformed or removed, but pioneering entrepreneurs still enjoy clear advantages. One example relates to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), as there used to be a quota placed on the number of IPOs permitted per year. The rationale is to protect investors who buy poorly performing stock. I further discuss this issue in the chapter on the Chinese model of governance. Within the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), committee meetings are held to <span aria-label="84" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84" role="doc-pagebreak"/>approve enterprises and add them to a queue of pending IPOs, and enterprises commonly lobby individuals within the CSRC to win a spot on this coveted list. In 2015, two CSRC deputy chairmen came under investigation and were later convicted. It was revealed that enterprises, through a chain of agents, would lobby and bribe them for permission to execute IPOs. Considering the life-­changing effects of an IPO that allows a founder of a corporation to quickly turn years of hard work into cash, it is no wonder why this is a major source of corruption in China. Nowadays, many of the regulations for IPOs have been reformed, and given the very tight policies against corruption, bypassing the remaining regulations has become very difficult.</p>

  <p class="text">In contrast, an IPO rollout in a mature market economy is purely market-­based. Investment banks work with enterprises to design an IPO plan. In principle, investors who end up buying a bad IPO stock have to blame themselves for not having done enough careful homework. Occasionally, the unlucky investors may file a legal case against the company. The government is not involved.</p>

  <p class="text">Another subcategory of economic corruption involves influencing a decision of a government official. One example is the case of Mr. Zheng Xiaoyu, the former head of the National Food and Drug Monitoring Bureau, which is in charge of approving or rejecting applications for new drugs and is also responsible for periodically reevaluating existing drugs. Before his downfall, Mr. Zheng Xiaoyu was an individual of great promise. He graduated from Fudan University, a top university based in Shanghai, as a biology major in 1968, when there were relatively few college graduates in China. He was considered an expert in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. In 1988, he was appointed as the head of the newly established State Drug Administration, which became the National Food and Drug Monitoring Bureau in 2003. Zheng was the first bureau director and was named a “model laborer,” an honor equivalent to a knightship in Britain.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="85" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Between 1997 and 2006, Zheng and his family took bribes from eight drug and pharma companies amounting to 6.5 million RMB (about 1 million USD). In return, all of these companies received quick approvals from the bureau. In 2000, one company submitted an application for a new drug and received approval within one week. In exchange, the company’s CEO invited Zheng Xiaoyu’s son on a vacation to Hong Kong and gave him a check for 1 million HKD, equal to approximately $130,000. This is only one of many bribes Zheng’s son is known to have accepted over the years. In one case, he received an Audi, which he sold for cash. In other cases, he received free shares in companies, which he also sold for cash. Furthermore, he received various gifts that he applied to a down payment on his apartment. Another company regularly sent him about 10,000 RMB a month. The amount of bribes Mr. Zheng and his family received may not have been as large as those accepted by others, but the fact that he took these bribes as the head of China’s National Food and Drug Monitoring Bureau ignited public anger, prompting China’s premier Wen Jiabao to take a special interest in his case and ensure it was pursued by prosecutors. In July 2007, Zheng was executed on orders from the highest court in China.</p>

  <p class="text">A much more prevalent form of economic corruption than that in the drug and pharma industry involves business contracts, land acquisition, and mining rights. With the property market booming over the past two decades, economic stakes in the Chinese property market have risen dramatically. The same is also true for corruption involving mining rights, as the price of coal and other mineral resources skyrocketed between 2000 and 2012. About five hundred kilometers from Beijing is the capital of the province of Shanxi, where China’s greatest concentration of coal mines can be found. Arguably, one can find the world’s greatest concentration of expensive Land Rovers and Hummers in Shanxi. It should not come as a surprise that Shanxi was formerly the most corrupt province in China until many of the province’s senior officials were purged between 2013 and 2016.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="86" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The second category, political corruption, can best be illustrated by Minister Liu Zhijun and Ms. Ding. Minister Liu is still remembered as the hero of Chinese rapid rail. He was the minister of the former Ministry of Railways, a fervent believer in rapid rail, and a workaholic determined to see his plans for the rapid rail system come to fruition. As a politically ambitious official, he had been frustrated that he was not promoted fast enough. Then along came Ms. Ding. When China was building its first high-­speed train from July 2005 to December 2007 (the first train began operation on August 1, 2008), companies competed for the right to manufacture the train’s toilets. These companies included one owned by Ding Shumiao, known as the “Queen of Toilets” and somewhat of a legendary figure in China. She was not well educated, having finished only primary school, but was a genuine entrepreneur who worked extremely hard and recognized the importance of knowing the right people. Ding started her business in international trade but gradually realized that railroads were big business. Hailing from the aforementioned Shanxi province, she knew that transporting coal outside of Shanxi faced bottlenecks, and whoever controlled the railroad freight routes (not the rapid rail system for passengers) would have access to an abundance of power and money. Ding thus began to cultivate her relationship with the railways, including the then-­minister of railways, Mr. Liu Zhijun. Using this relationship, she directly and indirectly bribed ministers for business contracts, including high-­speed rail projects ranging from supplying toilets and signal lights to constructing various parts of the track and other infrastructure.</p>

  <p class="text">A main reason why Liu Zhijun took bribes from businesspeople like Ms. Ding Shumiao was that he needed money to pay his own bribes, or “promotion fees.” Liu was an extremely capable government official and was largely responsible for the tremendous rise of China’s rapid rail. However, he was frustrated to watch many of his less capable and less accomplished peers earn promotions ahead of him. Eventually, he decided to cozy up to party officials <span aria-label="87" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87" role="doc-pagebreak"/>such as Ling Jihua, then chief of staff to Hu Jintao, the general secretary of the CCP at the time. Ling Jihua also happened to be from Shanxi province. With the money and connections provided by his relationship with Ding, Minister Liu was able to pay bribes to officials like Ling Jihua, allowing him to rise through the ranks. In 2013, Minister Liu was given a death sentence with delayed execution (in practice, this means life imprisonment). In December 2014, Ms. Ding was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment. Both cases attracted widespread attention.</p>

  <p class="text">Perhaps the most egregious case of political corruption involved two former military leaders, Guo Boxiong and Xu ­Caihou, who were so senior that they were outranked in the ­Chinese military hierarchy only by the president of the nation. They served as vice chairmen of China’s Central Military Committee, which is headed by the president and is the highest decision-­making body in the Chinese military. Perhaps their most significant power was the ability to influence decisions about promoting generals. According to a report from the <span class="italic">South China Morning Post</span> that cited a book written by a former subordinate of Guo, Guo had delineated an explicit price for each position. For a promotion to major general, he was asking for 5 to 10 million RMB. To become a lieutenant general, he was demanding 10 to 30 million RMB. In one case, a major general from the Nanjing Military District who wanted to be promoted to lieutenant general gave Guo 10 million RMB. Guo agreed to the promotion, but a few days later, when another major general offered 20 million RMB for the same position, Guo Boxiong awarded the promotion to the higher bidder.</p>

  <p class="text">The cases of Guo and Xu were by far the biggest corruption scandals in the history of the Communist Party. Not only were these men corrupt, but they were also discovered to have kept multiple mistresses. The Chinese military formerly had its own performing arts troupes, much like that of the Soviet Union and North Korea. Thus, it was very convenient for these two officials <span aria-label="88" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to find friendship with beautiful young artists in these troupes. Again, Xi Jinping’s reforms did away with many Chinese military performing arts troupes in order to focus the military on its mission: national defense.</p>

  <p class="text">The most corrupt subordinate promoted by Guo Boxiong was Gu Junshan, the head of the former General Logistics Department of the Chinese military. He was in charge of military procurement as well as building apartments for military officials. Gu was found to have accepted numerous bribes, and he also issued bribes to Guo Boxiong and his relatives. In one instance, Gu gave Guo’s daughter 20 million RMB, which Guo shipped in part to his brother’s house in a village. His brother then built a thirty-­meter-­long vault to store Guo’s loot from years of bribery—­a vault which was so full of liquor, wine, and art that it took multiple days and four trucks for anticorruption officials to empty it upon Guo’s downfall. In 2015, Guo Boxiong received a life sentence and Gu Junshan was given a death sentence with a two-­year delayed execution, which was later waived in exchange for a life sentence in prison.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Corruption in China is </span>perhaps among the most economically “efficient” forms of corruption in the world, which makes it all the more damaging. That is, in China, an unscrupulous individual needs only to bribe a few key decision makers—­and often just one—­with one-­stop payments to get what they want. In countries like India, for instance, corruption is less coordinated, meaning that one has to bribe many officials, and in the end things may not be done. Thus, Indian corruption is less efficient at getting desired results than in China.</p>

  <p class="text">Because of the highly efficient nature of Chinese corruption, it causes more damage to the political regime than to economic performance. In doing business, government officials can be motivated by bribery to make exceptions and give the green light <span aria-label="89" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to otherwise impossible business deals. Politically, however, this directly exposes key decision makers to mistrust by the population. In the Chinese case, the fruits of corruption fall largely into the pockets of a few powerful people, whereas in India, petty corruption could be perceived as routine income for low-­level government officials. This also explains why key decision makers get nervous when China launches a large anticorruption campaign.</p>

  <p class="text">More generally, the biggest cost of corruption is that it runs directly against the Communist Party’s mission to serve the people. The party claims to represent the interests of all people in China, whereas corruption embodies the diametrical opposite of this goal by serving only the interests of the most powerful. Therefore, corruption is despised by the general populace and undermines the party’s reputation. Whenever negative news comes to light, the internet is always abuzz with comments blaming corruption.</p>

  <p class="text">Beyond sowing seeds of distrust among the general public, corruption with regard to promotions also compromises the principle of meritocracy, which is held in high esteem by the party and is rooted in thousands of years of Chinese civil service culture. Corruption encourages the promotion of individuals who would not otherwise be competent enough to earn their positions in a competition of skill. In some local governments, you can see that the people in key positions are often the best social drinkers and connection-­builders, or those with the most prestigious family backgrounds. In recent years, when corruption was in high gear, many of my students told me that it was impossible for poor, hardworking, well-­qualified university graduates to earn senior positions or other highly coveted posts in the business sector, such as in large investment banks and even some foreign banks. Without a reference letter or introductory message from an individual with strong connections to the company, most candidates found it impossible to get even a first interview. Connections remained very impor­tant through the final stages <span aria-label="90" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of the interview process. Naturally, students detested this situation. Fortunately, this problem is not as severe regarding entry-­level government positions, since regulations in China stipulate that all entry-­level civil servant job offers must be based on the results of written exams.</p>

  <p class="text">Most ordinary people in China credit Xi Jinping for cleaning up Chinese corruption with his massive anticorruption campaign, although educated elites often voice their concerns about the side effects. The claimed side effects include the unchecked power of the anticorruption agency, which often leads to the blending of politics and anticorruption efforts. Another side effect is that many officials choose to be hesitant in their work for fear of making enemies who may provoke anticorruption investigations of an official’s historical cases.</p>

  <p class="text">Why does most of the population regard the anticorruption campaign as a success? It is hard to come up with precise supporting evidence. Two observations perhaps are relevant. First, during the first decade since Xi has been in power, as many as 17 percent of senior officials positioned as ministers, provincial governors, or above, were disciplined (in most cases sentenced) for corruption.<span class="endnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter6.xhtml#footnote-003">3</a></span> </span>This amounted to about 210 officials, while in previous decades, the number was less than 20! Second, by 2021, anticorruption investigations had become the number one worry of almost all government officials, making overt forms of corruption few and far between. The side effect, of course, has been overly cautious behavior by government officials.</p>

  <p class="text">What is the key instrument of the massive anticorruption campaign? It is the tough and elevated role of the party’s discipline inspection committees, which coexist with the party committee at each level of the government and had been rather sleepy <span aria-label="91" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91" role="doc-pagebreak"/>until the ascendency of Xi. The discipline inspection committees function side by side and often above the system of government attorneys or the procuratorates. The discipline inspection committees initiate and complete each corruption case before sending it to the procuratorates, who then take over and finish the formalities.</p>

  <p class="text">How do the party’s discipline inspection committees find clues to tip them off about a corruption case? In most cases, they rely on whistleblowers, broadly defined. Tradition in China provides for people to bring their grievances against corrupt officials to senior government agencies rather than the court. Interestingly, it is quite common for a grievance to come from the disenchanted lover of a corrupt official. When a lover brings personal or emotional grievances to the commission, the official in question is placed under full investigation, and both the lover and official are almost always convicted. This is because lovers are often directly involved in demanding cash and benefits from businesspeople who are trying to gain favor with the officials. In China, the joke is that lovers are the most effective weapon in the anticorruption campaign.</p>

  <p class="text">Throughout the anticorruption campaign, President Xi’s right-­hand man and the so-­called czar of the campaign has been Wang Qishan, one of the seven most powerful officials in China on the Standing Committee from 2013 to 2018. Perhaps the best way to describe his personality is as a combination of Vladimir Putin and Bill Clinton. Like Clinton, Wang is extremely intellectual and articulate. An avid reader, especially of history, he can speak on various subjects for hours. Wang is a “tough guy.” He is known to be a straight-­talker, always quick to the point, and is more outspoken than many of his peers.</p>

  <p class="text">At a large banquet that I attended around 2015, everyone stood up and moved to Wang’s table to toast to him, which is a Chinese way of showing respect. One of the Americans mentioned that Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary under <span aria-label="92" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" role="doc-pagebreak"/>President Clinton, had recently visited Beijing, and Wang took the opportunity to share a good-­natured story about him and Larry Summers. Wang said that when he met Summers for the first time at the China-­US Strategic Dialogue,<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter6.xhtml#footnote-002">4</a></span></span> he told him, “You are smart, but I can outsmart you in our negotiations because I read all the books you wrote, but you don’t read all of the books in Chinese that I read.” When Summers asked Wang for a book suggestion, he responded, “<img class="chinese" src="image/1.png"/>,” which is the <span class="italic">Analects of Confucius</span>. Wang told Summers, “If you can understand this one book, then you can rule the world.” Summers said, “I will read the English translation,” to which Wang joked that there would be no way for Summers, or any Westerner, to fully understand this book in its true meaning, since the essence of the book cannot be translated. Such a personality makes Wang Qishan stand out among Chinese officials, who are usually polite and reserved, while Wang is outspoken and often boastful in a joking way.</p>


  <p class="text">The anticorruption campaign requires a person with an impeccable reputation and no possible connection to corruption to lead it, and Wang Qishan fits this profile perfectly. He has no children, and his wife is a descendant of senior officials who were upright revolutionary veterans. Wang’s family situation is expedient, as it is often wives and children who demand bribes, sometimes even without the knowledge of the official. Wang is also a problem solver and implementer—­absolutely essential attributes for an anticorruption chief. I do not think that people had any idea he would make anticorruption one of the most impactful features of Xi Jinping’s leadership when he was first assigned the job.</p>

  <p class="text">Many people in China are concerned with the side effects of the massive anticorruption campaign. The first side effect is that <span aria-label="93" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" role="doc-pagebreak"/>government officials, especially those dealing with economic affairs, have now become inert. The reason is that active officials almost surely create enemies or grumbling groups, such as through the demolition of an old building to make room for new investments. These groups would bring their cases, and perhaps even historical cases, to the party discipline committee. On their path to promotion and their current positions, most officials have either intentionally or unintentionally engaged in practices that are not in compliance with today’s tighter government rules. In the Chinese reform process, laws and regulations are gradually implemented and then tightened. The anticorruption campaign is using today’s tighter regulations to judge the past conduct of officials, which occurred when the rules were either looser or entirely unclear. As a result, officials today are extremely hesitant to take any action that would make them stand out or draw extra attention, even if those actions are in the best interests of the locale or department they serve.</p>

  <p class="text">How much has the anticorruption campaign impacted economic growth? According to studies by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the anticorruption campaign caused a decline of 1 percent in GDP growth in 2014, while BNP Paribas estimated the slowdown to be in the range of 1–­1.5 percent. Fortunately, the long-­term outlook is brighter, since doing business might be easier with less corruption. According to a survey of seventeen economists by Bloomberg, the anticorruption campaign was expected to boost China’s GDP growth by 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent per year by 2020. Of course, it is very hard to confirm such predictions, as the COVID-­19 pandemic hit the world in 2020. The overall sentiment is that the anticorruption campaign is good for long-­term growth.</p>

  <p class="text">Another side effect is more subtle than the first one. That is, as many people have argued, the anticorruption campaign has become rather arbitrary and driven by politics. The ability to retroactively prosecute past behavior using today’s new standards <span aria-label="94" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94" role="doc-pagebreak"/>has resulted in rather flexible interpretations of corruption. A common pattern is the sale of shares in a bankrupt state-­owned enterprise to an official, who later becomes CEO and turns the enterprise profitable. By today’s standards, such behavior could easily be labeled as corruption since the price of the transaction is deemed too low given the high profit today, but whether such an official is investigated or not ultimately comes down to politics: for example, whether they have personal ties to allegedly bad officials or good ones.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">What are the future </span>prospects for corruption in China? Most likely, corruption as a widespread social phenomenon and source of discontent will give way to other social problems such as the high cost of childcare and health care. Following through with the immense progress made under the CCP’s fierce anticorruption campaign, the party is now following the strategies of Singapore and Hong Kong to institutionalize anticorruption practices.</p>

  <p class="text">The experiences of Hong Kong and Singapore are the most revealing and are carefully studied on the mainland. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong police and civil servants were extremely corrupt. However, the city was able to reverse this situation through the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). From the Singaporean experience, China has learned that in order to avoid corruption, the salaries of officials must be greatly increased. In Singapore, the pay for senior government officials is on par with the salary of a senior executive of a large corporation. Of course, with these high salaries come extremely high standards regarding the conduct and integrity of the officials. Eventually, this will become the practice of the Chinese government: high pay, high standards, and high expectations, along with stringent institutions and regulations to prevent and monitor possible corruption. China and Singapore share the same Confucian tradition of civil service.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="95" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A typical Chinese minister is now paid around 200,000 RMB a year (around 30,000 USD) and is provided with a 150 square meter (1,650 square foot) apartment and a chauffeured car. The apartment is granted to the minister for his entire life and may or may not be inherited by his children. This is a significant job perk, as the value of such an apartment in Beijing can easily reach half a million USD. Ministers also hold a very high social status, on which a monetary value cannot be placed. However, bureau chiefs, general directors of departments of ministries, and other sub-­ministerial-­level positions are different in this regard. Unless you pay these officials well, they may not be very dedicated to their job, or they may simply use their position as a stepping stone to other jobs or as a way to boost the careers of their children. To ameliorate these concerns, I expect officials will ultimately receive substantial salary increases, especially at the sub-­ministerial level. In many other countries, such as the United States, officials such as cabinet members are not very well paid compared to what they could earn in the private sector. Still, this situation is sustainable because these people enjoy high social status, in many cases have already made good money in the private sector, and can switch to the private sector following their term of service.</p>

  <p class="text">In 2018, China established the State Supervisory Commission to phase out the anticorruption campaign while maintaining the battle. The State Supervisory Commission is essentially the Party Discipline Inspection Committee but now also functions as a state anticorruption agency. It also monitors corruption cases involving non-­Communist Party members.</p>

  <p class="text">Most people in China seem to believe that the level of corruption in China will certainly continue to decline. The reason is that once the above-­mentioned policies are implemented, officials will maintain their influential social status while also being well compensated and held to correspondingly high standards. Government posts will be regarded as stable and prestigious positions <span aria-label="96" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96" role="doc-pagebreak"/>due to Confucius tradition, and young people will still consider a government career appealing.</p>

  <p class="text">After discussing the all-­impor­tant topic of the Chinese Communist Party and how it coordinates the operations of the central and local governments, as well as the issue of corruption, we are ready to move on and discuss the Chinese economy. How does it work and why has it been growing so fast with seemingly nonstandard market economic institutions? As a transition, I begin this discussion with an analysis of government in the economy in the next chapter.</p>
