  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_4"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter4"><span class="running-head">The Central<br/>Government</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is only one simple point that I try to explain in this chapter, which is that in China, various government and semigovernment agencies are all coordinated by the Communist Party, forming a sophisticated system of social-­political governance. I use the central government to illustrate this. Also, I explain that there are clear rules and logic to the operations of the governance machine, such as specific rules of promotion and discipline. Checks and balances do exist among the agencies, although they are not out in the open.</p>

  <p class="text">For example, one feature of China’s integrated system of governance is the concept of rank. Rank is a key part of the identity of an official when rotating through or moving up in the complex of the party or government agencies. The highest-­ranking officials are the seven members of the Communist Party’s Politburo Standing Committee, who are ranked as state leaders. These seven members have the role of president, premier, head of the National People’s Congress, and so on. Below them are those ranked as deputy state leaders. They include the chief staff of the party, vice premiers, and party secretaries of the four most impor­tant provinces and municipalities. Third in rank are the ministers and provincial governors. Fourth in rank are the deputy ministers and deputy provincial governors. Fifth in rank are ministry director generals and mayors of subprovincial municipalities. Sixth are the ministry deputy <span aria-label="54" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak"/>director generals and mayors of third-­tier cities. In addition, there are five lower ranks reaching to the base of the party and government hierarchy.</p>

  <p class="text">Why is rank so impor­tant? The simple reason is that rank reflects the status of an official, including salary and welfare benefits. Also, unless an individual is disciplined for wrongdoing, every few years until retirement that individual will move to a different position of the same rank or one rank up. For example, the minister of commerce could be appointed the party secretary of a province, which is a move to the same rank. That person could also be appointed as the party secretary of Beijing or Shanghai, one rank up.</p>

  <p class="text">What is surprising is that in Chinese society, all white collar professionals and their employing agency are implicitly associated with a government rank. For example, a dean of a school or college at my university, Tsinghua University, would be identified with the rank of a division chief (seventh in the hierarchy) since Tsinghua is ranked the same as a department of the Ministry of Education (sixth).</p>

  <p class="text">Why may nongovernment officials care about their implicitly associated rank? First, it is a vanity issue. At official events, the seating arrangement and the order in which participants are introduced are often determined by rank. Second and more impor­tant, rank matters hugely if a person ever decides to join the government. For example, a dean of a school at my university can be appointed as a deputy department general of a ministry of the central government, which is a promotion by one rank. That same dean cannot be promoted to a department general, two steps up, since individuals can be promoted only one rank at a time. Of course, many scholars, including myself, do not care about rank. However, many do care deeply and print their rank on their business cards.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span aria-label="55" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="smallcaps">The Central Committee of the </span><span class="smallcaps">Communist Party</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Let us now go through various branches of the government, broadly defined. The first branch is the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which houses three key departments: the Organization Department, which is the human resources department of the party; the Publicity Department, which is in charge of news and media; and the United Front Work Department, which is responsible for outreach to non-­Communist Party elites, including entrepreneurs. The Central Committee also has a secretariat that arranges the meeting schedules of top leaders and manages document flows, among other routine tasks. At the very top of the Central Committee is Secretary General Xi Jinping, who meets every week with his six colleagues on the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). With the secretary general at the helm, these seven (sometimes five or nine in the past) Standing Committee members make up the center of power in China.</p>

  <p class="text">Below the Standing Committee is a twenty-­plus-­member Politburo (usually twenty-­five). Some of the Politburo members are party secretaries of key provinces or municipalities such as Beijing and Shanghai. The Politburo usually meets once a month, either to make decisions on key issues or to hold study seminars and so forth. For example, one seminar topic might be the value chain of the modern economy. On such occasions a scholar would be invited to speak, and then Secretary General Xi Jinping would deliver a prepared speech.</p>

  <p class="text">Below the Politburo is the Central Committee at large, composed of about two hundred people. Most of these individuals serve as provincial governors and ministers of government ministries. The entire Central Committee meets once a year for a plenary session. Once every five years, a Party Congress is held and <span aria-label="56" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a new Central Committee is elected, which will vote for a new Politburo, Standing Committee, and secretary general.</p>

  <p class="text">In each province or municipality, the structure of the Central Committee is more or less duplicated on a local level, with the secretary of the party committee as the top official.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">The </span><span class="smallcaps">State Council</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The second arm of the central government is called the State Council, which is often compared to the cabinet of a Western government. The State Council is headed by the premier, who is also a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. The premier leads the other twenty-­plus ministers of various government departments, and they all meet once a week to review documents and decisions that require their attention. Such meetings often include heated discussions. As a hypothetical illustration, the minister of education may propose a reform to change the nine-­year compulsory education requirement to twelve years, to be sent to the National People’s Congress for legislation. During the deliberation, the minister of finance might point out that there are not enough funds to carry out the proposed initiative. Discussions can be intense, so ministers need to do their homework carefully. Also, the premier may not get what he wants, since a minister may come up with good counterarguments.</p>

  <p class="text">From time to time, the premier invites scholars to speak to the ministers about the economy or certain aspects of technology. I have participated in such events multiple times under premiers Wen Jiabao and Li Keqiang. During and following my seven-­minute presentations, the premier would ask questions and make comments, creating a lively discussion, with some of the vice premiers and ministers occasionally jumping in to answer questions.</p>

  <p class="text">On one occasion, I stated that the policy of toll-­free highway travel on holidays was not economically sensible. The premier quickly pointed at the minister of transportation, asking: “What is <span aria-label="57" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57" role="doc-pagebreak"/>going on? What is the rationale for the no-­toll policy on holidays?” As you can see, the cabinet meetings are always very interactive and less hierarchical than people might think. I even noticed that some key officials, such as the governor of the Central Bank or the minister of finance, would discuss among themselves even as the premier was speaking. The atmosphere was rather academic or democratic.</p>

  <p class="text">It might be very surprising to an outsider that the Chinese central government is actually very small compared to most Western counterparts, meaning that China is actually more decentralized than most people think. For example, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture only has about one thousand employees, mostly based in Beijing, while each province has its own bureau of agriculture that reports to the provincial governor. In contrast, the US Department of Agriculture has more than one hundred thousand employees, many of whom are situated in individual states. Of course, each US state also has its own agriculture department.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">The National </span><span class="smallcaps">People’s Congress</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Next is the legislative branch of the Chinese government, the National People’s Congress (NPC). Here, please keep in mind that the NPC is very different from the concept of a congress or parliament in a Western democracy. First, the NPC is composed of a large membership of almost three thousand delegates, representing different provinces or municipalities and elected for a term of five years by the People’s Congress in their home province. Therefore, this is a system of indirect election. This is like the old practice in Massachusetts, in which the state legislature elected the state’s senators. These three thousand members meet only once a year for about twelve days in March, when they gather to hear, review, and vote on reports by the premier, chief justice, and chief prosecutor. They also evaluate proposed legislation and vote on revisions to the constitution.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="58" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Every five years, the NPC members also vote on the appointments of the country’s next president, premier, ministers, and so on. This process is not the same as a standard election normally seen in a Western country. Instead, there is one candidate proposed per position, and the votes demonstrate the approval rating for each appointment. In the 1990s, at the city or provincial level, sometimes candidates for city mayors or provincial governors would receive less than 50 percent of the vote from the city or provincial people’s congress and lose the election. Nowadays, before the election, there are meetings with each group of the delegates to urge them to vote positively for the candidates. Even so, for most positions, there are still a few negative votes or abstentions; not all officials get 100 percent positive votes.</p>

  <p class="text">The NPC has a Standing Committee consisting of about 150 members, who are voted on by the NPC every five years from among approximately 180 candidates. This group is akin to a combination of the US Senate and House of Representatives. It functions as the chief legislative body of the country and meets once every other month, although major and new laws must be voted on by the whole NPC. Candidates for the Standing Committee are proposed by the Communist Party and elected by the entire NPC. Most of the Standing Committee members are not full-­time members. For example, the president of my university has been a member of the Standing Committee since 2018. He must attend every session, which creates major hurdles in his schedule that we must work around.</p>

  <p class="text">Are there cases of legislation being voted down by the NPC or its Standing Committee? The answer is no. This is because a proposed piece of legislation must face rounds of consultative discussions before making it to a vote. During the consultative process, objections are voiced and debate occurs. One example is the real estate tax (property tax). The Ministry of Finance has wanted it for almost a decade, but many NPC delegates and local <span aria-label="59" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59" role="doc-pagebreak"/>governments have serious concerns about its negative impact on property prices, land prices, and household burdens. As a result, as of early 2023, no property tax legislation of any kind has made it onto the NPC agenda.</p>

  <p class="text">Because of the system of indirect election, a delegate of a province may be nominated by the central government to represent a province he or she does not live in. For example, one of my colleagues, an expert in environmental protection and water resources, was nominated for the National People’s Congress. He was born in Beijing and lives in Beijing, so naturally he should have been a delegate for Beijing. However, there are many people with similar qualifications from Beijing, so he was instead nominated to represent the province of Yunnan, to which he has virtually no connection. Knowing that this person is an expert in environmental protection, the Yunnan delegates did not mind electing him, since he could become a new channel for Yunnan to make its case for the allocation of more resources for its use on relevant projects.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">The Chinese People’s Political Consultative </span><span class="smallcaps">Conference (CPPCC)</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, or CPPCC, can be loosely understood as the House of Lords of the UK. The 2,200 members at the national level of the CPPCC are invited. If they are party members, they are invited by the Department of Organization of the Central Committee. Nonparty members are invited by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In contrast to the House of Lords, there is a five-­year term, and usually the term limit is three terms.</p>

  <p class="text">The purpose of the CPPCC is to gather advice from a spectrum of elites before the party makes major decisions. CPPCC members are academics, scientists, writers, journalists, artists, movie <span aria-label="60" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stars, business executives, entrepreneurs, and so on, and—­very impor­tantly—­retired government officials. The national CPPCC gathers once a year in early March for about ten days, jointly with the NPC, during the meetings known as the Two Sessions. At the Two Sessions, the CPPCC and NPC hear and discuss the reports by the premier, chief justice, and chief prosecutor.</p>

  <p class="text">Before the premier submits the Government Work Report at the Two Sessions in March, he always convenes several rounds of consultation meetings involving academics, entrepreneurs, government officials, and even peasants. This is another avenue for the Chinese government to seek input from social groups beyond the appointed leaders and delegates. I have attended some of the consultation meetings myself, and I’ve found that they can be very open and interactive. In one session, I proposed that the government issue more debt, and Premier Li Keqiang instantly asked, “Doesn’t that mean I will have to incur a greater deficit for the central government?” He was reluctant to do this since he had promised at the beginning of his term that he would not increase the government deficit. I quickly replied that debt for infrastructure construction is classified as capital expenditure and is different from debt issued to pay for government expenses. Therefore, it would not be counted toward any deficits. I think he understood, but my advice was not taken, likely due to pressure from senior colleagues and retired top-­tier officials, who still unofficially check the power of current leaders.</p>

  <p class="text">Meetings of the CPPCC are usually very lively since members are typically well-­educated and free-­minded elites. Following the major plenary meetings in the Great Hall of the People, the CPPCC members are divided into groups of thirty to forty to discuss the premier’s report along with other social and policy issues. In my group at the CPPCC, we had a diverse set of members who are senior academics, painters, artists, actors, and screenplay writers. For example, one member is China’s leading <span aria-label="61" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61" role="doc-pagebreak"/>calligrapher, and he proposed that the government implement a policy to require primary schools to teach calligraphy, arguing that calligraphy is an integral part of China’s classical culture. His proposal later turned into a central government policy of the Ministry of Education. Another member, who is a very famous news anchorman akin to Anderson Cooper in the United States, openly criticized the Chinese government’s policy of allowing Western, especially American, genetically modified food to be imported into China. He claimed that foreign companies have bribed Chinese scientists to argue that genetically modified grain is safe. His view was seriously taken into account by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">The Courts and </span><span class="smallcaps">Law Enforcement</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The next section of the Chinese government is made up of the courts and law enforcement. Usually, at the level of the central government, these agencies are under the management of one person in the Politburo Standing Committee.</p>

  <p class="text">The police force is rather decentralized, similar to the situation in the United States. More specifically, each province and municipality has its own police force that reports primarily to the local leader rather than a national authority. At the highest level, the national police force is mostly responsible for nationwide cases that stretch across provincial or even international borders.</p>

  <p class="text">The court is more hierarchical and centralized. That is, local courts in counties and provinces are responsible to courts in the level above them. At the very top of the hierarchy, China’s Supreme Court is similar to those in other countries. This court carefully chooses which cases to try, with a focus on those with the potential to have a demonstrative impact on future similar cases. In recent years, the Supreme Court has also presided over each death penalty case, since China has been moving toward <span aria-label="62" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62" role="doc-pagebreak"/>reducing its death penalty sentences. The procuratorate—­that is, the office of the attorney general—­is also very centralized. In recent years, the amount of violent crime in China has dropped drastically, whereas white-­collar crime has increased. In line with this change, the procuratorate has become more discretionary in its punishments.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">Mass Organizations</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">The next category of government agency is unique to China: the so-­called mass organizations. In the United States, large organizations such as unions, YMCA, and United Way are independent. But in China, as previously explained, the party manages everything. Thus, in reality, these nongovernment agencies are managed as government entities under the party, sometimes labeled with the oxymoron “government-­organized non-­governmental organizations,” or GONGOs. The party is responsible for providing the budget of these organizations as well as approving and appointing all key leaders.</p>

  <p class="text">In China, if one wants to establish a new organization or association, he or she must seek a ministry-­level agency to act as a sponsor. Sometimes these organizations are led by retired government officials. For example, China once had a Ministry of the Textile Industry, which was abolished during reform and opening up because of the change to leaving industries to the market. Thus, the Ministry of the Textile Industry was replaced by the Association of the Textile Industry. The chairman of this agency is usually a retired deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information.</p>

  <p class="text">The Communist Youth League (CYL) is a unique organization with branches in high schools, universities, and most enterprises. In a remote way, it is similar to the YMCA or YWCA in the United States, but the CYL is political. The purpose of the CYL is to cultivate young people who may aspire to join the <span aria-label="63" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63" role="doc-pagebreak"/>party in the future. Yet the CYL can be very apolitical in many ways. For example, branches of the CYL often organize spring outings and fall excursions, as well as more serious activities like seminars on the sociopolitical issues in the country. The process of joining the league is relatively easy: submit an application statement and be approved by the league’s local branch. In many cases, the local branches are not very strict, and therefore most students are members of the CYL. Although members of the Communist Youth League may not be very politically motivated, the branch officials above a certain level are senior party officials who can be as old as forty-­five or fifty. At the highest level of the Communist Youth League is the Central Committee of the CYL, whose first secretary is ranked at the level of a minister or provincial governor. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the practice was for senior officials of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to be promoted to senior officials of the entire country, with two examples being Premier Li Keqiang and former general secretary Hu Jintao. In the era of Xi Jinping, this practice was phased out.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">The Military</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Unlike in the West, the Chinese military is managed by the party, as stipulated in both the Party Constitution and State Constitution. In practice, this means that China has one Central Military Commission (CMC) for both the country and the party, and the chairman of the CMC is always the highest-­ranking person in the party, who is now General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Central Military Commission also includes generals who serve as deputy chairmen.</p>

  <p class="text">Under Xi Jinping, the structure of the Chinese military was fundamentally reformed. The Chinese military force was formerly organized into seven military area commands across the country plus the air force and navy, whereas now there are five <span aria-label="64" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64" role="doc-pagebreak"/>theater commands with an emphasis on joint operations across military departments. Another focus of these reforms was to clean up widespread corruption in the military by severely punishing corrupt officials and greatly enhancing the pay of generals.</p>

  <p class="text">An often neglected fact is that China is the only major country that has not engaged in any warfare in the past four decades. Xi Jinping has said that in order to reach the goal of national revival, China will be tested. It is not clear exactly what he means by “tested,” but some people believe China’s big test will come from being challenged militarily and that China will eventually be involved in military action. While China’s leader has consistently emphasized that the Chinese military should be modernized and ready for combat, in actuality, the Chinese military is perhaps the least experienced among the largest powerful military forces in the world.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">How Does the </span><span class="smallcaps">Government Work?</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">Again, the simple principle is that the party manages everything. All key decisions are discussed and decided by the Politburo Standing Committee before being implemented by government agencies. Besides the general secretary, each of the other six Standing Committee members is in charge of one area. The premier and the executive vice premier are mostly concerned with the economy, while another member is in charge of media for the entire country, and yet another leads the work of cleaning out corrupt party officials (that is, discipline inspection). The heads of the NPC and CPPCC are also members of the Standing Committee.</p>

  <p class="text">The Chinese government does have internal checks and balances, though in a different way from traditional Western governments. For example, top leaders in China often seek inputs from retired leaders on critical issues, and this practice injects some continuity into Chinese government decision making. Furthermore, <span aria-label="65" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65" role="doc-pagebreak"/>as detailed in Chapter 2, Chinese leaders are always extremely conscious of how history will judge them, which pushes them to be cautious and consult with numerous experts before enacting consequential policies.</p>

  <p class="text">To illustrate the internal mechanism of checks and balances, take the example of legislation. When it comes to passing a law, a draft is usually proposed by a ministry and must go through numerous debates within the government as well as consultations with scholars and enterprise managers. In this regard, China is much more interactive and democratic than some people may assume. Take a specific example, the Labor Contract Law, which was enacted right before the global financial crisis in 2008. The group that led the charge for this law was the All-­China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), a ministry-­level mass organization. After drafting this law, the ACFTU proposed it to the National People’s Congress, which then organized many field trips to conduct research in regions where labor-­intensive industries are concentrated, such as Guangdong province. After at least three rounds of formal discussion, with countless negotiations, debates, and consultations with academics in between, the law was passed. However, numerous complaints have since been leveled against the Labor Contract Law, and the NPC is expected to revise the law in the coming years.</p>

  <p class="H1"><span class="smallcaps">Promotions and </span><span class="smallcaps">Term Limits</span></p>

  <p class="text-left">One key area that cements the primacy of the party in governance is that of promotions and personnel decisions. Promotions or demotions are first discussed by a branch of the Communist Party called the Organization Department. This department is similar to a human resources department, always monitoring vacancies, key issues, and potential candidates. The head of the Organization Department suggests candidates for senior-­level positions to the Standing Committee, which makes decisions <span aria-label="66" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66" role="doc-pagebreak"/>on the proposals. However, the Standing Committee generally approves the proposed promotions, since much of the research and background work has already been done by the Organization Department. Of course, the Central Committee Organization Department only presides over personnel decisions relating to the ranks of provincial governor and minister. Lower-­rank personnel decisions are made by the Organization Departments of local party committees.</p>

  <p class="text">The Organization Department is also in charge of training officials. Officials are trained in a manner similar to what corporation leaders get, only more formally. The party has its own training schools for this, which increase in importance all the way up to the Central Party School, which trains top officials. All officials must undergo training before being promoted, and they must also meet three basic criteria. First, they must have sufficient relevant experience and rise through the government hierarchy level by level. For example, Xi Jinping gained experience through leadership positions in counties, cities, and provinces, working his way up step by step. He also received training throughout his career. The second impor­tant requirement is that the person must have a clean record. A candidate with any outstanding issues about discipline—­for example, expensive consumption habits—­will not be promoted. The third criterion is age. For example, a person older than fifty-­eight will not be considered for promotion to the role of minister or provincial governor, who is normally required to retire before sixty-­five.</p>

  <p class="text">Age limits and term limits were established by Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s as he reflected upon the problems of Mao Zedong in his later days, especially the Cultural Revolution. It was very clear to Deng Xiaoping and many people in China that if Mao had retired twenty years prior to his death, many of his mistakes could have been avoided. The implicit assumption, with which most people agree, is that when someone is in a political position for too long, he loses touch. George Washington, for <span aria-label="67" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67" role="doc-pagebreak"/>instance, was wise to step down after two terms as president. In this regard, he is highly respected, even in China.</p>

  <p class="text">Although positions beneath the Politburo Standing Committee level do not have term limits, there are age limits acting as de facto term limits, ensuring that no official stays in one position for too long. There are now age limits pertaining to each governmental body. For example, a minister or ministerial-­level official must retire at sixty-­five. The director of a department of a ministry must step down by sixty. A person older than fifty-­eight is passed over as a candidate to be a minister. A vice premier must be under sixty-­eight at the time of appointment, and must retire before the age of seventy-­two. All these age-­dependent rules are clearly considered discriminatory against the elderly in Western politics. But in China, they have been designed by Deng Xiaoping to rejuvenate the otherwise conservative bureaucracy.</p>

  <p class="text">How is the top leader of the party and country such as Xi Jinping selected? And in principle, how is the top leader different from a US president? First, the candidate must have already been a member of the politburo or its standing committee. That is, jumping ranks does not happen. Second, the person must be younger than sixty-­eight and must have been a top leader of a major province and worked in the central government in charge of an impor­tant issue. Third, and most impor­tantly, the Organization Department conducts surveys with a few key groups. One group is the two-­hundred-­member Central Committee. Another group is retired officials, especially retired Standing Committee members. Finally, the members of the Politburo Standing Committee have a final say in choosing the top leader.</p>

  <p class="text">An old practice that seems to have become less significant in recent years is that each August, top leaders, including retired ones, would retreat to an oceanfront resort called Bei Dai He. This conclave served as a valuable opportunity to gather opinions on upcoming promotions. Even in years without a Party Congress, top current and retired leaders gather annually in Bei Dai <span aria-label="68" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_68" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He to unofficially discuss major issues facing the country. The uniqueness of the meetings is the involvement of retired officials. Though the meetings are generally quite secretive, given their importance, any information about the meetings is meticulously sniffed out and dissected by political analysts outside China.</p>

  <p class="text">As a result of the selection process, China’s top leader is usually much more experienced with national issues than his US counterpart. Another implication is that, compared to Western leaders, it is less likely for a Chinese leader to make drastically revolutionary decisions. Continuity is maintained in China. For issues like commitments to or agreements with the world on targets of climate change, continuity is essential.</p>

  <p class="text">A Chinese proverb says: “When the mountains are high, the emperor is far away.” This refers to the independent behavior of local government officials. Despite the powerful influence of the party reaching all the way from the highest levels to the lowest, local governments have the most direct effect on the average person’s day-­to-­day life, and as such, there is both more demand and more space for grassroots input at the local level. In the next chapter I explain the unique characteristics of Chinese local governments, since they matter critically in today’s China.</p>
