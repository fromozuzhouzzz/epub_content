  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n a pleasant June evening in 2011, nearly 2,500 people filled Toronto’s Roy Thompson Concert Hall. I stood on stage with three of North America’s most influential intellectuals: Dr. Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state; Professor Niall Ferguson, a leading historian and political thinker; and Fareed Zakaria, the articulate and thought-­provoking CNN anchor. We had gathered to debate the topic “The 21st Century Will Belong to China.” It was one of the first events of the Munk Debate series founded by Pete and Melanie Munk of Canada. The tickets had sold out within a week. When I first left China to study in the United States in 1985, debating such a topic, and having people pay to attend, would have been unthinkable.</p>

  <p class="text">I was assigned to the “pro” side along with Professor Ferguson. From the start, Dr. Kissinger had stated that the only way he would consent to be involved in the debate was if he could argue for the “con” side. He said that he was so concerned about Western paranoia concerning China following the financial crisis that his mission was to calm the Western world’s anxieties about China’s emergence.</p>

  <p class="text">I was easily the most uncomfortable debater that evening, although Dr. Kissinger claimed it was he, citing his training in the German education system, in which debaters take turns to make points to win the support of the audience. Truly, the event was a bigger challenge for me than for all of them. Debating is not in the skillset of Chinese scholars of my generation. We were taught in the Confucian tradition of education, with a strong emphasis <span aria-label="1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1" role="doc-pagebreak"/>on avoiding open disagreement and respecting scholars and the elderly. Of course, this would include Dr. Kissinger, who, along with President Richard Nixon, “opened up” the Sino-­US relationship with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai and is regarded as a legend in China. Even more impor­tant, I disagreed and (still do) with the position that I was supposed to defend, but I had to try to win the debate.</p>

  <p class="text">The debate was a challenge that I had to undertake. I believe that academics like myself who are so fortunate as to study and travel around the world must work to enhance mutual understanding between China and other countries. In the wake of the financial crisis, the Chinese economy had been leading a sharp global recovery. The prices of commodities, including gold, were shooting up. It was common for many Canadians and Westerners to wonder whether China’s time was indeed coming and what implications this would have for their lives.</p>

  <p class="text">The debate was conducted in strict Oxford style with participants presenting opening statements and the moderator requesting both sides to recommend issues to be considered. The distinguished audience included former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, former US secretary of defense William Cohen, and many leading writers and thinkers from the United States and China. Topics covered included China’s economic policies, whether China would become like Japan—­fading away as a major economic competitor of the US, —­and whether China would be able to innovate rather than only copy Western technologies.</p>

  <p class="text">I was surprised by the tremendous enthusiasm of the audience; those who could not gain admittance to the hall were watching it live on TV. Before the debate, a poll of the audience had revealed that 39 percent said they agreed with the “pro” position and 40 percent with the “con” position, with 21 percent undecided. Following the debate, 62 percent voted “con” and 38 percent voted “pro.” It was evident that Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Zakaria had won, and convinced the audience that the twenty-­first century would <span aria-label="2" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" role="doc-pagebreak"/>not belong to China. I was pleased for the same reason as Dr. Kissinger—­because I do not think people in Western countries should be concerned with China’s emergence. Another reason I was happy: I had not defeated a respected elder; my Confucian principles had not been compromised.</p>

  <p class="text">A revealing moment came during the debate that planted the seed for me to write this book, which eventually took more than a decade and much more energy than I initially anticipated. Dr. Kissinger shocked me by rhetorically asking me and Niall Ferguson: “Look at the world map—­how many friends can China truly claim? Especially look at the neighbors of China—­which are the largest in number for a country, how many of them are truly comfortable and trustful with the rise of China?” Coming from China and knowing how hard China has been trying to show its goodwill and earn respect from the rest of the world, I was stunned by his statement. I knew in that moment on stage that the world needed a better understanding of China and its world view, and that I needed to write a book about it.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">During the ten years</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>since the Munk Debate, China has taken center stage in world politics. For many reasons, the debate in the West has escalated from “Will the future belong to China?” to “How can we stop China from damaging the free world of liberal democracy?”</p>

  <p class="text">In 2020, during the COVID-­19 pandemic, many politicians and elites in the West began to label China as the new and most dangerous common threat, like the former Soviet Union, and advocate for a new Cold War against China. Of course, President Trump made a significant contribution to the hostility of the West toward China by openly claiming that China’s rise had been at the expense of the United States, saying that China had done too well for too long and it was time for the United States to fight back. His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in effect treated China as a <span aria-label="3" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3" role="doc-pagebreak"/>warring state by recalling the US ambassador to China, closing a Chinese consulate in the United States, and calling upon the Chinese people to rise up and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. Needless to say, the hostility from President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo also stoked the fire of ultranationalist and anti-­West views in China. Chinese social media was ablaze with personal attacks on Mike Pompeo as netizens bemoaned the United States’ intent to repress the rise of China.</p>

  <p class="text">A dramatic event happened on Saturday, January 28, 2023, that may one day be seen as a turning point in American perception of foreign affairs as significant as the first orbit of the USSR’s Sputnik satellite in 1957. That morning, Americans woke up to breaking news that an ultra-­high-­flying balloon had appeared in the sky of North America. This was unprecedented. The White House alleged that it was a Chinese spy balloon as large as a football field and flying twice as high as a commercial jet. More shocking than the appearance of the balloon was that a commercial pilot first spotted it, not the US military. The Chinese government stated that the object was a meteorological balloon blown astray by the wind. News of the balloon riveted the nation in the ensuing week. Local police admonished rifle owners not to shoot at it as the balloon was flying way beyond the range of any hand-­held weapon. Finally, on February 4, President Biden ordered it shot down by a missile launched from a US Air Force fighter. Regardless of the truth, the threat of China had suddenly been perceived to be real and present by many people in the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">Whether the rise of China is a threat or an opportunity for the West can only be answered by an honest understanding of how China works. So far, there are many books on China that have been published outside of China, most of them written by Westerners with deep knowledge and profound insights about the country. However, these authors are visitors and guests of China. They are like observers peeking through the windows of a building, and sometimes they even are invited inside. However, they do <span aria-label="4" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4" role="doc-pagebreak"/>not live in the building. I am an insider—­I live and work in the building. I hope to explain how the building was designed, how it was constructed, and how it functions.</p>

  <p class="text">I confess that I am not the most prepared or suitable author for a book of this sort. To begin with, oftentimes it is a struggle for me to write well in English since it is not my native language. To make things worse, I was trained as an academic economist, and academic economists’ writing style is too rigid and dry for a general audience. Most impor­tantly, I am fully aware that readers in the West may not trust me, since they may perceive me as being too close to the Chinese government, with ulterior motives to promote China.</p>

  <p class="text">As unprepared and ill-­suited as I am as a general writer, I have been increasingly compelled to finish this book. Throughout the past decade, I have witnessed the widening gulf of misunderstanding between China and the West, especially the United States. Suspicion and hostility have surged alarmingly, and many Western elites have even begun to advocate for a new Cold War against China. On the other side, in China, there are also many people pushing for an ever more aggressive stand against the West, and particularly the United States. These harsh views are an extremely dangerous escalation of mutual misunderstandings. The younger generations of all societies, in China and the West, stand to lose tremendously from a new Cold War.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Why should you trust </span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">me</span>? Are my views biased for China? I have encountered these challenging questions each time I speak at a public forum or give a media interview in the West. I can see the suspicion in the eyes and body language of my audience. My answer to them, and to you, is that I try to be as honest and matter-­of-­fact as possible. I do not face any specific pressure or incentives from inside China to say certain things, since I am an academic economist and not a government official. I do not own <span aria-label="5" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or run any businesses, and I have zero chance of being promoted to a high-­level government position. This detachment allows me to make my own observations and judgment calls. I think this is why I am frequently invited to international forums and investor conferences such as the World Economic Forum of Switzerland. There, top executives of a specific industry have told me that they value my assessment of what is really going on in China so that they can make impor­tant strategic decisions. They cannot afford to listen to distorted views and predictions.</p>

  <p class="text">Why should you trust me? I myself have asked this question time and again during the long journey of writing the book. Ultimately, I think the answer should come from understanding my motivation. I wrote this book not for the purpose of obtaining fame or monetary returns, which I have much more effective and efficient ways to achieve. Moreover, at a relatively senior stage of my career in China, I am no longer hungry for them. Reputation-­wise, I am running a significant risk of being attacked in China as a “traitor trying to please Westerners.” Conversely, outside China, I may also be criticized as an instrument of Chinese propaganda. My sole motivation is to promote a better understanding of China by the rest of the world in order to promote more cooperation and minimize conflict of any kind. The best way to do this is to be open and honest, guarding against any possibility of misleading the readers.</p>

  <p class="text">My ultimate goal in writing the book is for younger generations to benefit from the rise of China by avoiding any conflict due to misunderstandings. This goal stems from my personal experiences. Forty years ago, as a young student, I was very fortunate to be able to go to the United States for graduate studies. I then benefited from my Western education through working mostly in China. Today, while many young Chinese are following my path, many young men and women from outside China are also coming here for studies and career development. This trend will certainly <span aria-label="6" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stop or even reverse if misunderstandings between China and the West worsen.</p>

  <p class="text">My worries about conflict stemming from misunderstandings and misjudgments between China and the West were heightened by the life experience of one young American friend and former colleague. His story provided me with the final and most impor­tant push to finish this book. His name is Neil Schwartz. Neil’s story taught me that the rise of China can provide new opportunities for young people around the world, and also that we must not take such opportunities for granted.</p>

  <p class="text">Neil Schwartz was born and raised in the state of New Jersey in the United States. He was a hardworking, ambitious, and very respectful student, but he did not feel particularly comfortable in the US education system and, after graduating from college, he decided to give life in China a try. He studied Chinese and got into the international MBA program at Tsinghua University. This was the right choice for Neil. In China, he thrived. His hardworking and respectful personality made him very popular.</p>

  <p class="text">Neil gave himself a Chinese name, Chen Xiaoshuai, which means “young handsome guy,” imitating that of a famous movie director in China. After graduating, he stayed at Tsinghua to help the university president, who later became the mayor of Beijing, to set up the university’s international programs. The president liked him so much that he even tried to set Xiaoshuai up with a Chinese girlfriend, a common practice of Chinese seniors for their beloved subordinates. Xiaoshuai later went on to found his own investment company with Chinese and US investors, and most interestingly, he also learned the skills needed to become a popular speaker at China’s public conferences and on TV programs, discussing President Trump and US politics—­all in Chinese! These accomplishments, he often said, would not have been possible had he stayed in the United States. Unfortunately, all of these wonderful things suddenly came to an end in the summer of 2020, when Neil was in New Jersey, where he had to stay because <span aria-label="7" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of travel restrictions due to the outbreak of COVID-­19. He came down with a mental illness, and sadly, he passed away.</p>

  <p class="text">The end of Neil’s young life woke me to the fact that people like me have a responsibility to make our best efforts to ensure that China and the rest of the world stay closely connected, allowing younger generations to continue to benefit from this connectivity, and preventing the outbreak of another Cold War. This book is for the hundreds of millions of Neil Schwartzes in the world.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The key message of</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>this book is very simple: The rise of China is not a threat to the rest of the world, and in fact, will provide many global benefits. First, China is not in a position to export its ideology or overturn the current world order. This is because China’s sociopolitical system relies on two thousand years of tradition in combination with the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, creating unique national circumstances that cannot be replicated. Chinese leaders and elites know well that the Chinese sociopolitical system has worked well in China so far but cannot be exported to other countries. Furthermore, this system dictates that China focus on its own domestic affairs while seeking due respect from the rest of the world. By doing so, China creates new opportunities for people around the world and makes contributions to the global public good.</p>

  <p class="text">This book aims to provide an insider’s view of how China works and therefore why, rather than causing fear, the rise of China should be recognized as being good for the rest of the world. To do so, I first explore China’s place as “number two” in the world—­mostly economically—­and how China’s large population, non-­Western political and economic institutions, and huge potential for growth cause trepidation among many observers outside China. In the next chapter, I explain the importance of history to most educated Chinese people, including Chinese <span aria-label="8" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8" role="doc-pagebreak"/>leaders, and I offer a brief overview of that history to help readers understand the mentality of Chinese decision makers.</p>

  <p class="text">In subsequent chapters, I delve into the Chinese political system and the structure of the Chinese government so as to build a foundation for understanding the country’s economy, society, and foreign policy. I begin with an explanation of the origin and operations of the Chinese Communist Party, the ruling party of China. This is perhaps the single most neglected topic in most books about modern China, the key point being that the Chinese Communist Party is fundamentally different from the Communist Party of the former Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party is an alert, pragmatic, and adaptive party that fought to survive through nearly two decades of brutal war before assuming national power. Its roots stretch deep into China’s political history, and it is focused on nation-­building rather than rigid ideology.</p>

  <p class="text">Following the politics and government section, I discuss how the Chinese economy works. The key here is to understand how the government interacts with the economy in a fluid and pragmatic way. The Chinese economy of today is certainly not a centrally planned command economy. Private enterprises and entrepreneurs are driven, energetic, and dynamic, which has made many sectors of the Chinese economy as competitive as their Western counterparts. I also illustrate that China’s state enterprises are special entities that behave partially like private enterprises and partially like government agencies.</p>

  <p class="text">To understand China’s economic emergence, one must also analyze Chinese society, which is the topic of this book’s next section. In this regard, population is a major issue. China’s one-­child population policy has made perhaps a greater impact than any other policy in any part of the world. It has resulted in as many as four hundred million fewer people being born, a rapidly aging population, and pressure on society as two pairs of aging couples now often rely on one young couple to support their postretirement life. Education is another key issue; comparing China’s <span aria-label="9" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>education system with that of the United States may hold the key to understanding the future competition and cooperation between the two countries. Next up is pollution and the environment, and I explain that as bad as they are, pollution and carbon reduction present both a challenge and an opportunity for the government. This is because managing pollution is a test of government capacity, and eliminating China’s pollution may be treated as an investment and growth opportunity. Following this discussion, I cover the topics of the media and the internet. Many young people have become increasingly vocal in expressing their views online, and an outsider might be surprised to see how audacious they are. This also has broad implications for Chinese society, as explicit and implicit rules have emerged to deal with extreme online views.</p>

  <p class="text">Building on this illustration of various aspects of China, I move on to analyze whether the rise of China is likely to continue and whether there is a Chinese model of sociopolitical governance. I first evaluate the tremendous challenges that China faces in sustaining its ongoing momentum of development before concluding that overall, it is likely that China’s rise will continue. Along with this continued rise, there will be a few outstanding features of China’s sociopolitical governance and China’s world outlook. Such features include all-­responsible government, internal discipline in the ruling party, and respect-­centered diplomacy. However, such features may not warrant their own categorization as the “China Model.”</p>

  <p class="text">After discussing the inner workings of China, in the last part of the book I present a list of views that I call China’s world view. The first key view is that it’s most impor­tant to “finish homework before going to parties,” that is, to focus on solving domestic issues before spending much energy on global affairs. This means that Chinese leaders are mostly exhausted by domestic affairs. The second key view is that the fundamental goal of foreign policy is to gain proper respect rather than tangible interests. In combination, <span aria-label="10" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10" role="doc-pagebreak"/>these two points imply that China is not in a position to expand its ideology or undermine the current world order.</p>

  <p class="text">Finally, I come to the key message of the book, that is, the rise of China is good for the world. I first explain that the rise of China brings goods at lower prices, allowing the average US household to avoid a significant amount of expenditure and providing more jobs and career opportunities. I estimate that one of nine workers in agriculture or manufacturing in the world’s richest countries produces for the Chinese market, and one of fifteen workers in the tourism industry serves Chinese tourists. In addition, as many as four hundred thousand Chinese students are studying in the United States, and their spending is equivalent to the United States exporting 10 percent of its automobile production to the rest of the world.</p>

  <p class="text">I also show that China’s rise will provide more public goods for the world. Examples include a faster pace of scientific research, an additional space station, better efforts in combating climate change, and peacekeeping. Finally, the rise of China provides healthy competition for countries like the United States and prompts these countries to allocate more funding to education and research in science and technology, which have recently been falling for domestic political reasons.</p>

  <p class="text">All in all, the key message of this book is that the rise of China is good for people in every part of the world, and that it will be even better if only we can clear up misunderstandings and anxieties about China.</p>
