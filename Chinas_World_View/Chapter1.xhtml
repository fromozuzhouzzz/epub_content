  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o lay out the background for the discussions of the book, in this chapter I explain why the rise of China has caused widespread and deep concerns for many in the West. The first point of tension is that China does not seem to share the same ideology as the West. Moreover, the Chinese ideology, as presented by the Chinese government and officials, is hard for a Westerner to understand. The second factor is the huge size of the population and therefore the potential for China to grow even bigger, overtaking the United States as the largest economy before long. The third and fourth factors are money and the timing of China’s rise. That is, many Western countries, including the United States, are currently not in the best political or economic shape, which has made the rise of China all the more discomforting. These three factors make it particularly impor­tant to have a clear, factual understanding of how China works and what the implications of the rise of China are for the West.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Since the start of </span>the twenty-­first century, China has found itself thrust into an awkward and uncomfortable position as the world’s number two power behind the big number one, the United States. Indeed, China is currently the second-­largest economy in the world, with an annual GDP of approximately $18.3 trillion in 2022, trailing only the United States at $25 trillion. <span aria-label="12" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In many noneconomic aspects, China has also often placed second behind the United States, and sometimes has even placed first. Examples include the publication and citation of scientific papers, number of granted international patents, and expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D). Many in the United States and the West are worried by projections that by some time between 2030 and 2035, China will catch up with the United States in the total size of its economy, and one by one, many other national indicators.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter1.xhtml#footnote-000">1</a></span></span></p>

  <p class="text">In the past hundred years, there have been many other “number twos,” and none of them has been successful in replacing the United States as the world superpower. The Soviet Union was growing very rapidly during the 1930s and took advantage of the Great Depression in the West to pull ahead in its domestic infrastructure construction. In the 1970s, the West German economy was also growing quite rapidly, and the deutsche mark was positioned to challenge the US dollar’s international currency status. Later, in the 1980s, <span class="italic">Japan Is Number 1</span>, a best seller by Harvard professor Ezra Vogel, was seriously considered by many American readers.</p>

  <p class="text">Today, China’s emergence has aroused debates as to whether it will replace the United States as number one. One camp argues that China should not be feared by the West since China faces numerous severe problems of its own. Perhaps the most impor­tant <span aria-label="13" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and popular view has been articulated by political scientists such as Dr. Fareed Zakaria, who argue that history shows that when an economy reaches a per capita income over $10,000—­which China had attained by 2021—­its population will demand democracy, usually setting off a tumultuous process that will slow down or even reverse the trend of economic growth. These arguments are seemingly credible but demand careful analysis.</p>

  <p class="text">Despite the arguments that China will eventually collapse or no longer present a significant threat to America’s supremacy, many in the West have become increasingly concerned about China’s rise. I explain in the following sections that a few unique factors make the rise of China particularly alarming to many analysts in the West.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">To begin with, </span>China has been developing very fast without the standard institutions of a Western democracy, and this fact constitutes a threat to many observers and analysts. China is clearly a market economy: Most goods and services are bought and sold freely, land and capital are actively traded, and the overwhelming majority of enterprises are owned and operated by private businesspeople. Yet China does not follow the practices or possess the institutions of a Western democracy: There are no general elections for national leaders, no permission for open entry of new political parties, and the press, for the most part, is under government control. These qualities set China apart from the former Soviet Union, where the market was replaced by direct government planning, thus making historical analysis of China based on the US-­Soviet competition obsolete.</p>

  <p class="text">Because China does not follow the system of Western liberal democracy, many Western analysts are deeply concerned that if China becomes more powerful, it will jeopardize the way of life valued by Western democracies. For example, they worry that China will use technology and financial leverage to spy on the <span aria-label="14" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14" role="doc-pagebreak"/>American government and citizens, influence US elections, and purchase US companies, controlling their decisions to the detriment of US interests. As I illustrate later in the book, the concern that China threatens Western democracies is unfounded because, in the Chinese system, the government is overwhelmingly concerned with domestic affairs. China’s diplomacy is and will be centered around earning respect rather than tangible interests. The Chinese government would never be able or aspire to impose the so-­called Chinese model, if it even exists, on other countries, as this model only works in China, relying on thousands of years of culture and education.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Never before in history</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>has the world’s number two been as large as China in terms of population, and a large population means great potential. Compared with the former Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan, China’s population is 4.8 times, 10 times, and 28 times larger, respectively. This massive population is what allows the Chinese economy to be 73 percent the size of the US economy (as of 2022) with only about 17 percent of the per capita income at the market exchange rate. And a simple law of industrial or postindustrial market economies is that the larger the population, the greater the unified market, and therefore the greater the potential. Unified Germany after 1871 and the United States after the Civil War in 1865 both established a unified national market, leading both economies to grow very rapidly. Such a historical pattern is likely to repeat itself in the case of China, only with larger magnitude. China is positioned to host the world’s largest economy before long, with a conservative forecast at 2035.</p>

  <p class="text">Many in the West worry that China’s large size and growth potential will change their way of life. One example is Hollywood. By late 2020, China’s movie market had grown bigger than that of the United States, taking its spot as the largest in the world. <span aria-label="15" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As a consequence, Hollywood executives have devised ways to attract Chinese moviegoers, such as casting Chinese stars or even producing special Chinese versions with added or customized plots that cater to Chinese audiences. After graduating from a US university, my niece was once hired by a Hollywood producer to polish American screenplays and make them appeal to Chinese tastes. In the past, most Chinese characters in Hollywood films were depicted as devious criminals. The classic example is Dr. Fu Manchu, a dark and cruel character in a series of movies from the 1930s to the 1960s who embodied racist US stereotypes of Chinese people. Today, positive representation of Chinese characters in American-­made movies is increasing. For example, in a movie based on the Boston Marathon terrorist attack, a Chinese student’s Mercedes Benz SUV was hijacked by the terrorist. While watching the movie, I was very curious about how the screenplay would depict the student. In the end, he was portrayed as a decent and resourceful young man who helped the police track down the suspect.</p>

  <p class="text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an illustration of China’s potential ability to catch up with the United States. In early 2023, the world was shocked by the release of the ChatGPT and GPT4, promising to be the most significant technological breakthrough in decades. Within a month, the Chinese company Baidu launched its own version of ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, many users laughed at Baidu for how poor its technology was in comparison to ChatGPT’s. However, China is poised to rapidly catch up with the United States in AI because the progress of AI technology depends on three factors: engineers, computing power, and data. China has by far the world’s largest contingent of engineers, graduating each year 4.4 million new engineers from colleges, almost the same number as make up the US engineering workforce in total. Not surprisingly, the number of academic publications in AI from China is on par with that in the United States. Meanwhile, China has the world’s second largest reserves of computers and <span aria-label="16" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16" role="doc-pagebreak"/>computing power following the United States. Although the US government has embargoed the sale of high-­speed computer chips to China, for AI computing, connected computers can often do the same work as a few super-­fast computers. As for data, China has the world’s largest population of internet users, generating a huge amount of data for machine learning, which is the key to AI. All these factors suggest that the United States and China will be the leaders in AI development for years to come.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Of all the countries</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>in the world, China owns by far the largest stock of money to purchase foreign goods and assets, even though the Chinese economy is not yet the largest. This is because Chinese households and enterprises save more proportionately to their income or profit than their counterparts in the West. This makes China’s rise even more visible and controversial to outside observers. Broadly defined, <span class="italic">money</span> refers to cash plus bank deposits. It is the most liquid form of asset. At the end of 2022, China’s money stock RMB (Chinese currency) was equivalent to 39 trillion US dollars (one and one-­half times the GDP of the United States) at the market exchange rate. Roughly 40 percent of this amount is held by households, 50 percent by corporations, and around 10 percent by government agencies.</p>

  <p class="text">No wonder Chinese individuals are buying houses in California, Florida, New York, and Vancouver, while Chinese enterprises are purchasing enterprises like Smithfield—­a US meatpacking company—­and other manufacturing firms in the Midwest. Chinese money is also flowing into Latin America and Africa. This is perhaps only the beginning of an era of massive outward Chinese investment. The Chinese government already has $3 trillion of foreign currency reserves in hand, ready to be tapped by private investors in China. As of 2022, this is worth 12 percent of the US economy, and could hypothetically buy about 7 percent of all companies listed on US stock exchanges, more than half of the <span aria-label="17" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17" role="doc-pagebreak"/>goods produced in Japan in one year, or two times all the stocks listed in London or Australia. This magnitude is worrisome to many outside China.</p>

  <p class="text">Controversies arise when Chinese corporations enter foreign markets and buy foreign companies. A good example is Germany, whose success rests in the large number of family-­owned small and medium companies boasting years of trade knowledge in their respective sectors. Combined with the Chinese market, these companies could be even more successful, but many German policy makers are fearful that the new Chinese owners might move companies out of Germany or siphon off their technology, rendering the German economy less competitive. Sany is a nonstate company making construction equipment and one of the world’s largest in its field. In 2012, Sany gained ownership of Putzmeister, a medium-­sized German company in the same industry. The owner of Sany, Mr. Liang Wengen, was not permitted to visit the factory before the purchase was finalized due to German concerns over technology theft. He told me that when he first stepped into the production area after the deal was finally done, he felt that he had gotten a better deal than he originally thought. Putzmeister had even more technology than he anticipated and would be highly valuable to Sany. Of course, such a takeover could never happen today, as Chinese companies are now perceived to present a huge threat to Germany, and any such transactions elicit vehement political and media opposition.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The increasingly visible rise</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>of China comes at the worst possible time for the United States and the West. They face many troubles, and as a result, their confidence has taken a hit, causing them to overstate and overreact to the rise of China. When China began to reform and open up during the 1980s, the West had charismatic and confident leaders. These ideologically <span aria-label="18" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18" role="doc-pagebreak"/>charged leaders were tough and confident, yet pragmatic in dealing with the former Soviet Union. As for China, these leaders felt that they could change China through trade and educational exchanges, leading China to become a larger version of Japan or South Korea.</p>

  <p class="text">I recall, as a young student in the mid-­1980s in the United States, that I was imbued by the optimism, openness, and confidence of the country. In lecture halls, I heard speeches by many iconic Western public figures, from Ted Kennedy to Ted Turner. Regardless of their political stances, these figures were all relaxed, humorous, and confident not only about their views but also about the United States as a nation. Meanwhile, my American friends would patiently and proudly explain to me things like the seemingly chaotic and brutal game of American football as well as the local and presidential elections.</p>

  <p class="text">The confidence of the West peaked in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. However, at the beginning of the twenty-­first century, the terrorist attacks in New York City triggered twenty years of war in Afghanistan and eight years of war in Iraq, costing thousands of American lives and over 1 trillion US dollars. By 2008, the global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crises greatly eroded the West’s optimism and confidence, leading many to wonder whether China would take over, as I described at the beginning of this book.</p>

  <p class="text">The lost confidence of the United States greatly amplifies and distorts the threat of the rise of China. In politics, continually fewer people in the United States believe that the United States and the West can change China. Instead, with the political chaos during the Trump presidency, culminating in the stunning farce on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021, many worry that it is China that will interfere with and change the United States. This worry caused the former top US diplomat, Secretary Pompeo, to say something incredibly undiplomatic: He called for the Chinese people to rise up and overthrow the “evil” Chinese Communist <span aria-label="19" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Party. This would be equivalent to top Chinese officials calling on US citizens to vote out the Democrats and install Donald Trump as an autocrat!</p>

  <p class="text">The bad timing has made many US policy makers and analysts often behave like sour coaches of a sports club, blaming the opposing team for playing dirty rather than finding ways to improve themselves. President Trump constantly blamed China for many socioeconomic problems in the United States. For example, he claimed that China “stole” US jobs and technology through trade. The US administration eventually imposed tariffs as high as 25 percent on almost all goods imported from China, kicking off the largest trade frictions since World War II, especially considering the wide scope and huge volume of Chinese exports to the United States. By early 2022, it became clear that the tariffs hurt US households so much that the Biden administration found ways to significantly roll them back.</p>

  <p class="text">The blame game against China is often accompanied by aggressive diplomacy and negotiations. In a CNBC interview, I called this the “barking dog” strategy. President Trump carried his real estate developer’s approach into his dealings with China. In the trade war, he would ask for a long list of concessions from China and openly tweet his tariff threats. This made negotiations unnecessarily difficult, as Chinese culture often pays more attention to how a demand is made than what the demand is. A polite request is more likely to be successful than an aggressive one. The Biden administration has been less aggressive but still is unnecessarily so. For example, in March 2021, President Biden’s young director of national security, Jake Sullivan, opened a face-­to-­face session with his Chinese counterpart by saying: “We are negotiating with you from a position of power.” A position of power, whatever it means and regardless of its truthfulness, is an unusual expression in diplomacy. It is most likely that this rhetoric was for the US domestic audience, implying that the United States is still the more powerful one and will not make any concessions. <span aria-label="20" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Sullivan’s Chinese counterpart rose to the occasion, responding that “we Chinese never yield to any bully.” The whole sequence was unnecessary and counterproductive. The confident President Reagan would not have spoken to his Soviet counterpart in the same fashion.</p>

  <p class="text">It is very unfortunate that the bad timing of China’s rise has made it more difficult for China and the United States to work out their differences. The two sides are not very far apart on many issues concerning China’s economy, since Chinese leaders know that further opening up and reform is needed for China’s own good. Even with the aggressive President Trump in office, the two countries’ leaders could have worked something out. In fact, I heard President Xi say in a session that he told President Trump, “Some people say that I do not like you and I wish that you were out of office. This is not true. You represent US interests and I represent Chinese interests. That’s it. As individuals, we are friends.” In a speech in St. Petersburg, Russia, in June 2019, President Xi also openly stated that President Trump was his friend.</p>

  <p class="text">Because of the events of the Trump presidency, many people in China, both educated and uneducated, have come to the conclusion that the United States as a whole cannot accept further development of China and will do everything in its power to squeeze and contain China into remaining number two forever. They point to the fact that when the Japanese economy reached three-­quarters the size of the US economy in the 1980s, the United States waged a trade war against Japan so that today’s Japan would never be in a position to challenge the United States. Now, the Chinese economy finds itself in the same position as Japan once did—­its economy is three-­quarters the size of the US economy. As such, US behavior is focused on impeding China.</p>

  <p class="text">For all these reasons, including China’s non-­Western ideology, large size, huge stock of money, and bad timing, the rise of China has been identified as one of the gravest challenges in historical <span aria-label="21" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21" role="doc-pagebreak"/>terms for the United States and Western democracy as a whole. Is the rise of China truly an epic challenge to the United States and the West? To answer this question, we need to understand how China works and how China views the world. In the next chapters, I dive into these topics. I hope by the time you reach the latter part of the book, you will agree with me that the rise of China is eventually beneficial for the world and therefore should not be feared.</p>

      <p class="footnote"><span class="footnote-number"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter1.xhtml#footnote-000-backlink">1</a></span> Economists often argue that the actual size of the Chinese economy has already become larger than that of the United States. According to a 2020 report by the World Bank, the purchasing power parity exchange rate of the Chinese currency RMB is 4.18 for each US dollar. That is, 4.18 RMB can buy as much goods and services in China as one US dollar does in the United States. At this exchange rate, the Chinese economy by 2021 was already 20 percent larger than the United States’. In this book, I stick to the conventional calculations of the size of the Chinese and US economies, which are calculated by market exchange rate, since this is based on market transactions and is more widely used.</p>
