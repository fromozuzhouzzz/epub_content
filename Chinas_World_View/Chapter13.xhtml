  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">P</span>opulation is a complicated issue in all countries, and in this chapter, I attempt to explain the Chinese situation in simple language. After listing a few possible reasons why China has such a huge population, I illustrate how the debate between Chairman Mao and a legendary economics professor resulted in a laissez faire population policy in the first thirty years of the current government. After this, at the beginning of the reform and opening up era, a one-­child policy was implemented, reducing global population growth by possibly as many as three hundred million. The one-­child policy by 2020 had been phased out. Finally, I argue that population aging is a grave social problem, but is not an insurmountable obstacle to continued economic growth.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Why does China have </span>such a huge population? This is a very simple question but is very difficult to answer. There are many possible reasons. As a fact, the period of largest and fastest increase in population was between 1500, the middle of the prosperous Ming Dynasty, and 1840, the beginning of the Opium War of the late Qing Dynasty. China’s population grew from 102 million to 412 million during this time, increasing by about 300 percent. In comparison, during the same period, India’s population grew from 110 million to 227 million, Italy’s from 11 million <span aria-label="170" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to 23 million, and France’s from 15 million to 35 million. In most European countries, the population grew by about 2 to 2.3 times.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter13.xhtml#footnote-008">8</a></span> </span>Why did China experience much faster population growth than other regions in the world during this period? It might be because during this period, as a large and unified country, China was relatively stable, with significantly fewer wars than other regions. Another factor is that Confucianism as the dominant belief system has traditionally promoted the idea that a filial son should have as many children as possible. Yet another possible factor is that for whatever reason, China did not suffer from repeated pandemics like the Black Death in Europe. Some believe that the traditional Chinese medical theory and practice, with its philosophical analysis of the human body and herbs and acupuncture, has been effective not only in dealing with pandemics but also in enhancing humans’ reproduction.</p>

  <p class="text">Population policy became one of the first major debates after the Communist Party gained national power, and provides a striking example of how Chairman Mao made critical decisions. Ma Yingchu is a legendary figure in Chinese academia. When he was in his early 20s, he passed the Qing dynasty government exams and was sent by the Qing emperor to the United States to acquire expertise in metallurgy (the study of metals) because the emperor and his ministers felt that China needed to develop the technology to produce iron and steel. Instead, Ma studied economics, obtaining a master’s degree from Yale in 1910. Four years later, he earned a PhD in economics from Columbia. His dissertation on New York City’s public finance was later used in a freshman textbook at Columbia. When he returned to China in the 1920s, he became a fierce critic of the government under the Nationalist Party. Chiang Kai-­shek, the leader of the Nationalist Party, who happened to be one of Ma’s high school students, once invited Ma to dinner through an assistant. Ma refused, saying a student <span aria-label="171" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171" role="doc-pagebreak"/>should invite his teacher in person. What a proud academic! Chiang later imprisoned Ma for supporting the student protest movement against the government.</p>

  <p class="text">Partly due to his derision of Chiang and the Nationalist government, Ma was initially very well respected and treated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In response to a personal invitation from Zhou Enlai in 1949, Ma returned from Hong Kong, a popular city for Chinese top scholars, where he had sought refuge during the Civil War from 1945 to 1949, and joined the new government. He was appointed deputy minister of finance in the central government. In 1952, he was appointed the president of Peking University. As an economist, he soon observed that the population in China was growing too rapidly and argued strongly with persuasive statistics that China needed to control its population growth in order to modernize. According to his studies, the population growth was over 2.2 percent a year. He argued that at such a rate, by 2000, China’s population would be about 2.6 billion, which would be greater than the 1952 population of the entire world. Based on this, Ma wrote many articles and delivered proposals in person to Mao and Zhou. His argument was extremely compelling: dealing with population growth should be a key part of the government’s central planning. Mao initially was very supportive, but by 1958, he came to believe the exaggerated reports by local officials that China was producing more grain than could be consumed. As a result, Mao reversed his position and said that human beings are valuable and therefore, the larger the population the better.</p>

  <p class="text">The initial tone of the debate between Mao and Ma on population policy was friendly, and Mao joked with Ma by asking, “You claim that China’s peasants are having too many kids because they don’t have electricity and have to go to bed early every evening. Yet you have seven kids and you have electricity every night.” Soon, however, the tone turned malicious. Mao was extremely angry with the movement that saw Chinese intellectuals <span aria-label="172" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172" role="doc-pagebreak"/>attacking the party. By 1958, Professor Ma was labeled a Malthusian. Thomas R. Malthus was a British economist who argued that the human race was doomed because the population was growing too quickly, and only wars and pandemics could solve the population problem. Ma was attacked and was named a public enemy of society. Already in his 80s, Ma knew that he could not win the battle and had to bend against the wind. In order to survive, he burned all his manuscripts and tried to become an ordinary citizen.</p>

  <p class="text">Ma was a scholar with a big heart and tremendous fortitude. He not only survived the political ordeal but also became one of the few political enemies who outlived Mao. By 1979, three years after Mao’s death, China, under Deng Xiaoping, began to implement the family-­planning policy and Ma became a huge hero. People said that because Ma lost his debate against Mao, at least two hundred million more babies were born in China. As an economist, Ma never proposed forced abortions or other harsh policies to control the population; instead, he proposed that every family have only two children, and should be encouraged to do so through an annual bonus. Families who had more than two children would not receive the bonus. Ma died in 1982 at the age of 101 and was perceived to be one of the extremely rare cases of a political and intellectual enemy of Mao who not only outlived Mao but also eventually reversed Mao’s policy.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line">In 1980, Deng Xiaoping </span>adopted a policy of “one child per family.” The idea was to control the population in China to mitigate social problems associated with a large population. The one-­child policy was rigorously implemented among people who were employed by state enterprises, the government, universities, and all other local institutions. If an employee of these organizations was found to have more than one child, the person would be fired.</p>

  <p class="text"><span aria-label="173" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When the one-­child policy was announced, there were two very different reactions. In 1979, cities were crowded and housing was in extremely short supply. Furthermore, the unemployment rate was extremely high, and many parents were forced to retire earlier, in their late 40s, in order for their children to be employed in the same factory or institution. In urban houses, the average living area for a family of four was sixteen square meters (170 square feet). Thus, urban residents accepted the one-­child ­policy with relative ease. My brother, who is sixteen years my senior, does not regret having only one child. In 1978, he and his wife were struggling in Beijing after returning from a village to which they had been sent. They had to squeeze into a tiny room with his in-­laws. Why would they want to have a second child?</p>

  <p class="text">In rural areas, however, peasants still followed the traditional Chinese belief that “the more children, the more fortune.” They showed a drastically negative reaction to the one-­child policy and tried various ways to evade it. Sometimes wives would get pregnant and go to other cities or villages to deliver the baby, avoiding detection by local officials who were responsible for enforcing the one-­child policy only among their locality’s residents. In the early 1980s, a popular comedy show called “The Guerrilla of Kids” appeared on Chinese TV. It parodied a peasant family that had so many kids, they had to wander around the countryside to avoid punishment. The show was intended to illustrate that the traditional idea of having many children was obsolete.</p>

  <p class="text">Many observers claim that the one-­child policy spawned a significant gender imbalance beginning in the early 1980s because many couples sought abortions after ultrasonic tests, but careful study shows that such claims grossly exaggerate reality. True, the official statistic of baby boys to girls was 116 to 100 in the 1990s, while the global ratio was 106 to 100. However, careful studies in the 1990s and early 2000s show that the boy-­to-­girl ratio was actually normal, since peasants would choose not to register their baby girls with the local government so they could get a second chance <span aria-label="174" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174" role="doc-pagebreak"/>at producing a baby boy. But when the girls were seven years old, the parents would register them to attend school. Thus, by age seven, the population began to balance out gender-­wise and the ratio moved close to 106–­100 as parents began to register their young daughters who were not registered at birth.<span class="footnote-number-callout _idGenCharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="Chapter13.xhtml#footnote-007">9</a></span></span> The failure of hospitals to register these births can most likely be attributed to bribery on the part of the parents<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>during this period of time.</p>

  <p class="text">In reality, how tightly was the one-­child policy implemented? I have a habit of doing my own small-­scale field research on this. When I go to restaurants in China, I often find a friendly way to ask the waitress where she’s from, and in almost every case she comes from a rural area. I then ask whether she has a brother or sister, and over 80 percent of the time, she says she does. In fact, the national average is 1.7 to 1.8 children for each Chinese adult female. Also, whenever I take a taxi in China, I choose to sit in the front row and try to get friendly with the driver and conduct an easygoing conversation. After a few questions, I often ask the driver how many kids they have. Taxi drivers in large Chinese cities are usually from the suburbs and were farmers until the early 2000s. In most cases they reply “two,” and then I ask how they got around the one-­child policy. They tell me that they paid fines, usually amounting to one or two years of an average villager’s annual income. In cities, government or state-­owned enterprise employees did not have this option, since the one-­child policy was strictly enforced in cities. My administrative assistant was her family’s second child due to an accidental pregnancy. She has often said that her father blamed her for his inability to get a promotion as a high school teacher because of his violation of the family-­planning policy.</p>

  <p class="text">The one-­child policy has been an emotional issue both inside and outside China. Many politicians, academics, and activists in <span aria-label="175" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the West argue that the one-­child policy was a blatant violation of human rights and that families should have the freedom to choose whether to have children, and how many to have. Former president Jimmy Carter held the same view against China’s one-­child policy. In 1979, he hosted Deng Xiaoping on Deng’s official visit to America. This was a historic meeting, the first visit by a Chinese leader after the two countries resumed normal diplomatic relations. At the top of President Carter’s agenda was hopefully to persuade China to abolish the one-­child policy. President Carter supposedly gave long lectures to Deng Xiaoping on how horrible the policy was. In his usual concise and dry style, Deng Xiaoping replied by saying, “Mr. President, I have a proposal for you: We abolish the one-­child policy, but the US agrees to accept ten million immigrants from China each year.” At that, the discussion on the one-­child policy abruptly ended.</p>

  <p class="text">There are different demographic, philosophical, and religious views with any population policy, especially in China. Environmentalists tend to agree that, given China’s huge population, without an initial curb on population growth, the world would have been burdened by an even larger and increasingly unsustainable population. However, people holding certain religious or philosophical views may argue fervently, as did President Carter, that childbearing is the ultimate human right and the government should not interfere.</p>

  <p class="text">Regardless of its moral implications, China’s one-­child policy was arguably the world’s largest carbon-­reduction or save-­the-­earth program, if not by intention, since it resulted in hundreds of millions of fewer births during three and one-­half decades. There is a wide range of estimates on the exact number. China’s Family Planning Commission, which now exists, stated, as might be expected, a high-­end number in order to highlight its achievements: four hundred million. Meanwhile, some population scholars in China argue that even if there had not been a family planning policy, China would still have had approximately <span aria-label="176" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176" role="doc-pagebreak"/>two hundred million fewer births since income increased rapidly during the same period, and the general rule is that the higher the income, the lower the birth rate. Interestingly, Steven Mosher, an American demographer who is the director of the American Population Institute, agreed with China’s official number of four hundred million.</p>

  <p class="text">One can calculate how much extra carbon dioxide would have been produced without the one-­child policy. With the rapid increases in China’s living standards, energy consumption, and longevity, roughly speaking, China will save the equivalent of half of the European Union’s carbon emissions between 2000 and 2060, when China aims to reach carbon neutrality.</p>

  <p class="text">It should be emphasized that the one-­child policy has caused a huge sacrifice for one generation of the Chinese people who were born between 1950 and 1980, since the one-­child policy was implemented between 1980 and 2016, when most of them got married and gave birth to their children. The pain of this generation comes in three ways. The first is obvious: They had to forgo the freedom to have as many children as they desired.</p>

  <p class="text">The second pain of this generation will come when they get old, as there will be proportionately fewer young people to take care of them. This also means that elderly care will be increasingly expensive. It is widely agreed that China’s population is rapidly aging, with three stages to this trend. The first stage extends from 2001 to 2020. It is estimated that by 2020, 17 percent of the population was sixty-­five or older, while 12 percent was eighty or older. The second stage, covering 2021 to 2050, will be the accelerated aging period. By 2050, 30 percent of the population will be sixty-­five or older, while 22 percent will be over eighty. During the third stage, between 2051 and 2100, it is predicted that the population will stabilize, with 31 percent being sixty or older and 25–­30 percent being eighty or older. Even assuming that China will implement a flexible retirement age, more than 20 percent of the population will consist of retirees who will have <span aria-label="177" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to be supported by the younger generations. The impact will be enormous: It is estimated that China will have to spend over 20 percent of its GDP supporting the elderly.</p>

  <p class="text">Yet there is a third type of pain for the generation impacted by the one-­child policy. That is, the assets they have saved may lose value as the population ages. Some economists have argued that by the middle of the 2020s, housing prices will collapse because many elderly people will sell their housing stock to young people, who are much fewer in number. Such predictions have not been realized, but indeed there are signs that increases in housing prices began to slow down by 2019.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line">The one-­child policy has </span>now been phased out. In fact, when Deng Xiaoping announced the one-­child policy, he said it would only last for thirty years. By the end of 2015, all families were allowed to have two children, and in 2021, the policy was relaxed to three children. In reality, most families can have as many children as they want.</p>

  <p class="text">Given the relatively low consensus forecasts of the Chinese population, before long, China will implement policies to encourage childbearing, since most young families have a decreased desire to have children. This is almost a universal phenomenon across countries of different cultures and religious beliefs. The reason for this is simple and economic in nature. That is, with social and economic development, women are more likely to be employed, greatly increasing the costs of childbearing. The key to help stabilize the age structure of the population is to reduce the cost of childbearing and child care as much as possible.</p>

  <p class="text">Indeed, the Chinese population has already peaked with a minor probability of rebound. The Chinese government announced in early 2023 that the Chinese population decreased by 850 thousand in 2022 and the population at the end of 2022 was 1.411 billion. It is possible that after the COVID pandemic, young couples may <span aria-label="178" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178" role="doc-pagebreak"/>have a higher desire to give birth to babies. However, the consensus among demographers is that the Chinese population more or less has peaked at around 1.411 billion. This also means that by 2022, India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country.</p>

  <p class="text">Many analysts have long argued that the Chinese economy, like Japan’s, will soon run into a state of very low growth due to population aging and the decrease of the population. Their argument is very simple: There will be more and more retired people to be taken care of by the young, and therefore there will be pressure to tax young people at a higher rate to pay for retiree care, thus reducing their work incentives. Professor Cai Fang, a former vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, one of China’s government-­established think tanks, has argued that because of the one-­child policy, the labor supply in China already peaked by 2015 and China’s economic growth will slow down significantly. According to him, the Chinese growth rate will decrease from almost 10 percent between 1978 and 2018 to around 4 percent by 2035, not much higher than that of the United States.</p>

  <p class="text">Based on very careful analysis, I do not believe the above pessimistic view holds water. In 2022, my colleagues and I published a research report on this. We found that due to the improvements in health and education, partly thanks to the one-child policy, the effective total labor supply will continue to increase until 2050. Labor supply is defined as the population between sixteen and sixty-­five. However, effective labor supply is the product of the healthy population above sixteen multiplied by their labor skills as measured by education. We found that between 2022 and 2050, there will be a 17 percent increase in the effective labor supply, which means that China will have an effective labor supply in 2050 that is equivalent to having a population of 1.644 billion that has the same level of public health and education as the population of 2020. This is because the average education level of the population has been rapidly increasing, with about 50 percent of young people attending college by 2022. Therefore, the quality of the labor force will make up for the loss <span aria-label="179" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of quantity. In addition, the average health measured by the proportion of healthy and active people is improving for each adult age cohort. As a result, older members of the population will be increasingly willing and able to work given flexible retirement policies. The reform of flexible retirement will be extremely impor­tant in mitigating the aging issue in the Chinese case. As of 2022, there had already been extensive discussions of such reforms, and most likely they will be implemented before long.</p>

  <p class="text">Given that population aging is unlikely to be an insurmountable challenge to China’s continued economic growth and ability to catch up with the West, will there be other critical problems stalling China’s development? Will the rapid rise of China turn out to be a super bubble that will burst before long? In the next chapter, we address these very impor­tant questions.</p>
