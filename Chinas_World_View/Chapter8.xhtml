  <h1 class="chapter-title" id="sigil_toc_id_8"><a href="contents.xhtml#Chapter8"><span class="running-head">State-­Owned<br/>Enterprises</span></a></h1>

  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hina’s state-­owned enterprises (SOEs) often stand out in discussions of the Chinese economy and require an in-­depth analysis. Their existence is the main reason why China has not been accepted as a market economy in many international trade and investment treaties, since SOEs are blamed for violating market principles. In this chapter, I make two simple points. First, except for a small number of national monopolies, the majority of SOEs operate and compete in the marketplace just as private enterprises do. Second, SOEs are undergoing continuous reforms, and most of them will be transformed into modern corporations similar to IBM or Bosch. Instead of directly controlling SOEs, the Chinese government will mostly hold shares of various corporations, as pension fund managers do. The Chinese economy will be subject to diminishing direct control from various levels of government.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">State-­owned enterprises are </span>enterprises in which the government holds the largest number of shares. This gives the government the authority to appoint the chairman of the board, fill top management positions, and approve key decisions. An SOE may be managed by the central government or by a provincial or subprovincial government. There are three main types of SOEs.</p>

  <p class="text">The first type of SOEs is large monopolies managed mostly <span aria-label="111" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111" role="doc-pagebreak"/>by the central government. They exist in such sectors as natural resources, commercial banking, telecommunications, commercial jet manufacturing, and power transmission. PetroChina, one of the top ten national oil companies in the world, is a state-­owned enterprise that was listed on the New York Stock Exchange between 2000 and 2022. Its output of crude oil ranks among the top five globally, and it has more than five hundred thousand employees, making it one of the largest employers in the world. No reason was given for its 2022 retreat from the New York Stock Exchange, but many believed the move was made to prevent US investors from demanding national secrets from China’s energy sector. About 130 state-­owned enterprises similar to PetroChina are under the direct control of the central government. However, just twenty of them account for 50 percent of the total profits of all SOEs. These SOEs include China Mobile, Bank of China, China Unicom, China Telecom, Construction Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)—­the most profitable commercial bank in the world. These star SOEs are all listed in the top half of the world’s Fortune 500 list.</p>

  <p class="text">The second type of SOEs are enterprises in competitive industries. They are supervised mostly by provincial or subprovincial governments. One cluster of these SOEs consists of joint ventures in automobile industries, including the Shanghai Automobile Industry (with joint-­venture partners GM, VW, and so forth) and the Beijing Automobile Corporation (with joint-­venture partners Hyundai and Mercedes Benz). They exist because, as in many other developing countries, the government used to require companies like BMW to form joint ventures in order to produce in the country. However, this regulation is gradually phasing out.</p>

  <p class="text">Many surprising cases are among the second type of SOEs. While McDonald’s represents a quintessential symbol of American capitalism, in the city of Beijing, McDonald’s restaurants are <span aria-label="112" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112" role="doc-pagebreak"/>all SOEs that have franchise agreements with the McDonald’s corporation. They are actually owned by the Beijing Capital Agricultural Group. Why? When McDonald’s entered China in the late 1980s, the municipal government was the largest landlord, so it was easiest for McDonald’s to let a Beijing SOE figure out the tricky job of renting store space. McDonald’s has been very profitable, so the city of Beijing has not allowed it to privatize.</p>

  <p class="text">Similar to McDonald’s, Quanjude Peking Duck, the most famous restaurant in Beijing, is an example of a Beijing SOE that persists for historical reasons. Quanjude is an “old-­brand” restaurant, which means it specializes in cuisine from a particular city—­in this case, Beijing. In China, every city boasts its own brands of restaurants. Quanjude was originally founded in 1846 and has become the most famous brand of Peking Duck. After the Chinese Revolution in 1949, it was gradually collectivized and then eventually transformed into a state-­owned enterprise under the Beijing municipal government. It is now a listed company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The Beijing municipal government, through the Beijing Tourism Group, owns majority shares in Quanjude.</p>

  <p class="text">The third type of SOE, which is still emerging, is that of investment funds. Almost all levels of government in China have such funds. A successful example is an investment fund of the city of Hefei, the capital of Anhui province. In 2019, the Hefei investment fund provided cash to the electric car producer NIO when its New York share price dropped to as low as 1 US dollar. In exchange for this investment, the city of Hefei required NIO to build a production plant in Hefei. By 2021, NIO’s share price went up to around 50 US dollars, and its production plant was working overtime, not only producing NIO cars but also paying taxes to the city of Hefei. The Hefei government won not only by getting higher share prices but also by collecting tax revenue <span aria-label="113" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from NIO’s production. Of course, not all government funds are as successful as Hefei’s.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Why do SOEs exist? </span>The simplest answer to this question is “history.” That is, many SOEs are legacies of the command economy era before China’s reform and opening up. At the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the original view was that enterprises and production assets must be owned by the government—­a defining feature of a socialist economy. When the Communist Party assumed power, its initial plan called for the nationalization of Western-­controlled companies, which the party called “imperialist companies.” That is precisely what happened, for instance, with commercial banks such as Citibank and HSBC. This is no different from what occurred in many other countries in the past, such as those in Latin America and Africa, following their independence from colonial rule. The Chinese Communist Party initially decided that it was necessary to make a gradual transition from the capitalist economy that had existed under the Nationalist government to a socialist economy, and intended to take fifteen to twenty years to gradually nationalize or collectivize enterprises.</p>

  <p class="text">Mao drastically sped up this plan of gradually nationalizing capital through the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Farms were collectivized, and ownership of individual household land was centralized into people’s communes. Assets in commerce, service, and industry were quickly nationalized. In the early 1930s, my mother’s parents owned and managed many pieces of property in the city of Nanjing, which was the capital of the Nationalist government. Their property was confiscated by the Communist government during the Great Leap Forward. In exchange, my grandparents were given some cash and relocated to a distant suburb of Nanjing, where they built a small house and lived off <span aria-label="114" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the remainder of their government payment. The extended family used to consist of over fifty members, and when it was time for lunch or dinner, the head of the family had to ring a bell to call everybody to the dining hall. However, in the suburbs, the extended family no longer lived together. It was only my grandparents, and their living standards suffered a huge decline—­they found it very difficult to survive. Fortunately, my mother was already working, and I remember that every month she would send one-­third of her salary home to support her parents.</p>

  <p class="text">In the reform era starting in 1978, the Chinese government began to gradually privatize SOEs because many SOEs had become unprofitable and ineffective. For example, the city of Shenyang, China’s industrial stronghold, used to have six thousand industrial SOEs; by 2021, fewer than twenty still existed. It was a painful process for Shenyang, and the most difficult period was the late 1990s, when as many as sixty thousand SOE workers lost their jobs. The city gradually recovered with the help of the central government and a joint-­venture plant with BMW, which now contributes about one-­third of the city’s fiscal revenue.</p>

  <p class="text">The process of privatization can be summarized as “let go of the small and hold on to the large.” That is, small and unprofitable SOEs were either sold to individual private owners or liquidated. Meanwhile, the government has maintained its ownership of the largest enterprises, partly because the large ones are often monopolies and are profitable<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4">.</span></p>

  <p class="text">The second reason for the existence of SOEs is to stabilize public finance. Although tax revenue tends to fluctuate with the macroeconomy, in an economic crisis, if the government already owns assets—­even minority shares—­it can use these assets as collateral to issue debt or simply sell some of the shares to help balance the budget. This is the logic underpinning the sovereign wealth funds found in many other countries. For example, the Singaporean government owns several large investment funds, holding many <span aria-label="115" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115" role="doc-pagebreak"/>assets in China and the United States, including industrial parks in China and stock-­issuing companies all over the world.</p>

  <p class="text">The third reason why SOEs exist is that they can help the government implement certain policies that private enterprises may not. An obvious example is the Beijing Olympics in 2008, which was conducted on a grander scale than any Olympics in history—­particularly the opening and closing ceremonies. Recent Olympics have proven to be enormously unprofitable and can burden a city with debt for many years. However, in the case of Beijing, the municipal government was actually able to turn a small profit. How was this possible? The simple answer is that the Beijing municipal government, with the help of the central government, made numerous requests to state-­owned enterprises—­such as to build a special power plant near the Olympic Park. In addition, SOEs were asked to rush deadlines for building facilities and roads, and were even requested to assist in ceremony rehearsals.</p>

  <p class="text">The fourth reason for the existence of SOEs in China is ideological, though this may well change over time. This ideological view holds that China is a socialist economy and the Communist Party is the party in power, so SOEs should be the cornerstones of the political regime. On its surface, this argument is logical, but in reality, it does not hold water. It is simply overkill for the government to directly own so many assets for maintaining political governance. The reason is that the government collects taxes on all enterprises, and the taxes for an average enterprise can easily amount to at least 20 percent of total sales. As a result, the government is already a huge stakeholder in every enterprise, not just SOEs. All enterprises are the basis of political governance..</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Do SOEs behave differently </span>from other types of enterprises, such as private ones or multinationals? The answer is no, in general. Because of decades of tough market competition <span aria-label="116" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and selection, the overwhelming majority of SOEs are competitive and owned by local governments. Most of them are listed on the stock market. Unprofitable ones have already been privatized, since Chinese governments do not want to be burdened by subsidies. Moreover, most of the remaining SOEs have very strong and independent senior executives who are often respected and revered by local government heads.</p>

  <p class="text">The leading example is Gree Electric, which is one of the world’s leading home appliance producers. It boasts an extremely capable and charismatic CEO in Dong Mingzhu, perhaps even more powerful than Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of HP. Dong is popular, articulate, and most impor­tantly, powerful. She has even appeared in commercials for her company on China’s national TV, saying that there is no need to hire expensive movie stars like Jackie Chan to serve as advertising spokespeople for Gree when she can do the commercials for free. Gree Electric is one of the star companies on the Chinese stock exchange and boasts prominent investors such as the Yale University Endowment Fund and TEMASEK, an investment fund run by the Singaporean government. It might surprise you to learn that Gree Electric is a state-­owned enterprise owned by the city of Zhuhai, which has been designated a special economic zone. In a TV panel with Dong Mingzhu, I joked that she should acknowledge an impor­tant factor of her success: that she has a nonmeddling “mother-­in-­law.” By mother-­in-­law, I refer to the government of Zhuhai. Usually an argumentative person, she readily agreed, adding that the Zhuhai government had indeed acted in an extremely laissez faire manner in her case.</p>

  <p class="text">There are quite a large number of local SOEs like Gree, each having a powerful leader like Dong Mingzhu. They include Weichai Power in Shandong, Conch Cement in Anhui, and XCMG in Jiangsu. When I attend public events with the senior executives of such companies, I often joke with them by asking whether they <span aria-label="117" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" role="doc-pagebreak"/>would trade places with the CEO of a central government-­owned enterprise. The answer is always “Never.”</p>

  <p class="text">In the case of one to two dozen super-­large SOEs of the central government, the top executives are appointed by the central government, and they may be promoted or rotated to a government position at any moment. Therefore, such state enterprises need to pay more attention to central government policies and social responsibilities, such as supporting the Beijing Olympics. But the senior executives’ daily responsibility is to make their company competitive in the marketplace. Most of them are very capable. I come across the senior executives of these SOEs often. One occasion was the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Walking out of a closed-­door session, the top executive of a top-­five world mining company stopped me to ask: “David, please explain to me why that guy from Chinalco (China’s largest aluminum firm) is really on top of his business and knows everything, much better than many executives from Western companies. How come?” My answer was that his top priority is profitability, and he was chosen for that when Chinalco was doing very bad financially, although he also has to be watchful of politics.</p>

  <p class="text">Another example is ICBC, the world’s largest and for many years most profitable commercial bank. Mr. Jiang Jianqing, the former chairman of the board, is the longest-­serving commercial banker in China. He comes from southern China and has an extremely sharp mind regarding finance and management. At one point, Mr. Jiang’s salary was around 1 million RMB, but it is now limited to 600,000 RMB, which translates to approximately $100,000—­a number hardly on par with the importance of Mr. Jiang’s job. As in effect a political appointee, he had no choice but to accept this.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Two significant SOE reforms</span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>are under way that will make SOEs function like other companies, moving the Chinese <span aria-label="118" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118" role="doc-pagebreak"/>economy closer to a mature market economy. The first reform is to transform most SOEs into mixed-­ownership companies with majority shares held by nongovernment entities, greatly reducing the direct influence of the government. Consistent with the first reform, the second reform is for central and local governments to hold investment funds instead of directly managing SOEs. The government-­owned investment funds invest in all kinds of individual companies.</p>

  <p class="text">These reforms were openly declared by the government. They were first announced in November 2013, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party held its Third Plenary Session, which approved an elaborate document outlining the full economic reform program for the next eight years. Again, in November 2017, the same reforms were affirmed by the Nineteenth Party Congress. The documents state that transitioning to mixed-­ownership is the goal—­that is, converting many of the existing solely owned SOEs into enterprises with partial private ownership. The other component mentioned is the intention to encourage SOEs to hire senior executives from the marketplace rather than having them appointed by the government.</p>

  <p class="text">Why the reforms? A major reason is that with the progress of the market, Chinese governments find it increasingly unnecessary to own SOEs to help solve their problems. Directly purchasing services from nonstate enterprises is becoming a more attractive solution than owning an SOE to provide the same service. One simple example is that many local governments no longer own a fleet of cars or buses—­instead, they sign a long-­term service contract with a private transportation company. This allows the government to avoid details like the hiring and firing of drivers and provision of their pensions. Another example is the case of dining services in government buildings, which used to be run by the government. Now, most government branches outsource their dining services to private food service companies.</p>

  <p class="text">Another reason for SOE reform is international. Xi Jinping <span aria-label="119" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is very ambitious, aiming to become one of the world’s most progressive leaders. This was demonstrated in his aggressive carbon-­reduction goals. More impor­tantly, against the trend of antiglobalization, he has demonstrated that China under his leadership wants to be a leader in globalization. In January 2018, he made such a proclamation in his speech at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. To be a leader in globalization, Chinese SOEs have to become like other enterprises competing in the market. Thus, SOEs have to become independent of direct government influence.</p>

  <p class="text">Practically, in the future, it is highly conceivable that there will be several TEMASEK-­type funds in every city. TEMASEK, an investment fund run by the Singaporean government, is managed almost entirely with open market principles, with the main purpose of making a profit. Local government funds will invest in individual enterprises, so at the grassroots level, it will be difficult to identify which enterprises are state-­owned and which are private. All enterprises will have shares owned by the local government.<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>For the city of Beijing, I have specifically proposed that Beijing’s municipal government should own three to five large funds. Each fund would invest not only in enterprises with significant government ownership but also in private and foreign enterprises. These funds would compete with each other and would be reported annually to the local People’s Congress. To me, this would be an effective way to enhance the efficiency of enterprises while greatly reducing government interference in the overall economy. Most impor­tantly, once these funds are properly managed, the Beijing municipal government’s public finances will become more stable. In the event of another global financial crisis, Beijing will be able to use some of its shares to issue bonds in the financial market.</p>

  <p class="text">What is the most impor­tant piece of evidence that SOE reforms will come to fruition so that nonstate enterprises, including foreign companies, will have easier access to the Chinese market? <span aria-label="120" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In November 2020, President Xi Jinping made a formal speech in front of the leaders of APEC (Asian-­Pacific Economic Cooperation) countries, including the United States and Japan, stating that China is willing to join the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-­Pacific Partnership). The CPTPP is a more demanding version of the TPP (Trans-­Pacific Partnership) proposed by President Obama. The TPP was designed to exclude China by essentially disallowing SOEs. Therefore, China’s announced desire to join means that substantial reform must occur so that SOEs will behave in the same way as non-­SOEs. Otherwise, countries like Japan would never give the green light to China’s application to join.</p>

  <p class="text">As interesting and unique as SOEs are, the dynamism of the Chinese economy has not been due to their existence. Rather, this dynamism stems mostly from China’s emerging private enterprises and entrepreneurs, who come from all parts of Chinese society. Next, we analyze in detail China’s private enterprises and entrepreneurs.</p>
