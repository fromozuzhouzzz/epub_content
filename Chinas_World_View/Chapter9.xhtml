  <p class="chapter-open"><span class="dropcap">P</span>rivate businesses are the most dynamic forces behind China’s economic growth, accounting for over 75 percent of the country’s economic output and 90 percent of nongovernment employment. This is why it is essential to understand the workings of private businesses and their creators, private entrepreneurs. In this chapter, I first explain that during the past four decades of rapid growth, the Chinese economy has benefited from several distinct generations of entrepreneurs. Second, Chinese entrepreneurs have to successfully deal with two impor­tant issues: They need to overcome two thousand years of prejudice against businessmen and to work closely with the government. Third, although the government has established special institutions for private entrepreneurs to participate in politics, since 2021, it has grown wary of some of the entrepreneurs interfering in politics and policymaking. As a result, the government has waged a so-­called campaign against the disorderly expansion of capital. This campaign is expected to ease off before long since Chinese economic growth is critically dependent on active entrepreneurs.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">The era of China’s </span>rapid economic growth, starting in the early 1980s, has seen several generations of private entrepreneurs. <span aria-label="122" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The first generation, about thirty years ago, consisted of poorly educated but extremely competent peasants. For various reasons, these motivated individuals could not receive a formal education or become senior government officials or scholars. This left entrepreneurship as their only remaining option to make money and improve both their material comfort and social standing.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Cao Mingfang, who was born in a small village not too far from Shanghai in the 1930s, received only a primary school education. He was the party secretary of the small Communist Party branch in his township. Mr. Cao knew very well that it would be impossible for him to become an impor­tant party or government official or a scholar. The only way to establish himself would be to become successful in business, and in the process to generate income for his fellow villagers.</p>

  <p class="text">In the mid-­1980s, Mr. Cao found a perfect opportunity in China’s emerging automobile industry. Automobiles were in extremely short supply in China. In order to stimulate economic growth, up until the 1980s, the Chinese government followed the Stalinist development strategy of investing in heavy industries, including capital goods such as trucks. Unfortunately, the result was that the heavy industries mostly did business with each other rather than serving the real economy as intended. This caused China to experience an acute shortage of consumption goods, ranging from watches to automobiles. One response was that around 1984, Shanghai Automobile Industrial Company (SAIC) and Volkswagen (VW) of Germany formed a joint venture. However, as a prerequisite for entering the Chinese market, the government required VW to achieve a sequence of goals pertaining to the percentage of parts produced locally, known as the “local content requirement.” The purpose of this policy was to increase Chinese employment and accelerate technology transfer.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Cao quickly found that providing parts for VW Shanghai was a golden opportunity. At the beginning, VW officials were stumped by the problem of local supply. Mr. Cao was the head of <span aria-label="123" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123" role="doc-pagebreak"/>his township-­owned enterprise, which at the time was involved in the production of export goods like toys and Christmas candles. In an extremely bold move, Mr. Cao knocked on the door of a Shanghai VW executive without any appointment or introduction and proposed that his enterprise be involved in production. The VW executive regarded Mr. Cao as a lowly peasant and did not take him seriously, politely rejecting him by presenting an apparently impossible task: to come back within thirty days with a model of the bumper for the VW Santana. However, the executive underestimated Mr. Cao, who returned to his village and literally hammered out a model bumper. When Mr. Cao returned to VW, the person who received him had long forgotten about his assignment, that is, until he saw the bumper model. Ultimately, Mr. Cao was awarded a contract to produce fifty thousand bumpers—­too small a number to attract any investment in the project. He met his target by cutting costs and borrowing money from banks, and his township enterprise ultimately lost money on the deal. Mr. Cao knew this would happen from the beginning, but he chose to make the deal anyway because he had bigger future deals in mind. Indeed, Mr. Cao’s company grew into Jiangnan Mould &amp; Plastic Technology Co., LTD, which has developed into the major supplier for not only VW, but also BMW, GM, and Mercedes Benz. The company is even expanding internationally into Mexico to produce bumpers for BMW’s Mexican plant.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Cao has a motto for his son and his whole company: “Work a little bit harder than everyone else, don’t fear hardship, and don’t fear short run losses.” After rising to success, Mr. Cao realized the importance of education and sent his eighteen-­year-­old son, Robert, to live with his business partner in a small town in Germany. Initially, Robert spoke nothing but Chinese, but he returned to China speaking fluent German. However, Mr. Cao realized that Robert could not successfully function in China with only German business experience and knowledge, so he sent Robert to the business school at Tsinghua University in Beijing. This enabled <span aria-label="124" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124" role="doc-pagebreak"/>him not only to receive China’s foremost business education, but also to accumulate social connections through his classmates and faculty members. Robert is now the CEO of the family-­owned company, which is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. I have known Robert for many years now, and he has introduced me to a number of German business executives who wish to learn about the Chinese economy. As a result of his well-­rounded education, Robert has been able to help his family expand its business into wind-­power equipment production, hospitals, and equipment leasing. Robert, who was born and raised in China and college-­educated in Germany, is now a rare crossbreed of the two cultures. He established the Dusseldorf China Center, an exchange hub for economic, cultural, political, athletic, and media cooperation between China and Germany. In March 2013, President Xi Jinping even visited the center (I was also there as a member of the Sino-­German Economic Advisory Council). At no small cost, Robert arranged to have meals delivered to the Chinese delegation after the official banquet, as Chinese officials and businessmen often feel ill when they do not eat a Chinese meal for a few days. In China, people often say that good relationships start with a good meal, so Robert was very wise to provide this much-­needed service. He has become a trusted partner of many government agencies.</p>

  <p class="text">The second generation of entrepreneurs consisted of former government employees—­some being retired soldiers or junior military officials—­who were highly disciplined and had beneficial business connections. In the mid-­1990s, as the saying goes, a wave of government officials took the “leap into the ocean,” quitting their government jobs and entering the business world. In over 90 percent of the cases, the husband leapt while his wife “stayed dry,” keeping her government job as backup.</p>

  <p class="text">A prominent figure in this generation is Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which has become one of the world’s largest property developers and owns the world’s <span aria-label="125" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125" role="doc-pagebreak"/>largest cinema chain operator (including AMC Entertainment). Mr. Wang used to be known as the “Bill Gates of China,” boasting the nation’s highest personal net worth of over $20 billion for a few years in the mid-­2010s. As a developer, Dalian Wanda Group was highly profitable and is already listed on the global Fortune 500 list, easily overshadowing the Trump Organization by more than one hundred times.</p>

  <p class="text">Two main factors in Mr. Wang’s background have helped him achieve this enormous success. First, Mr. Wang joined the army in 1970, when he was sixteen. This was considered a privilege at the time, since it exempted him from laboring as a peasant. Undergoing military training at such a young age shaped him into a person of discipline, adopting the succinct and precise speech so often seen in people with military backgrounds in China. In fact, I have appeared on television discussion panels with Wang Jianlin on a number of occasions, and I was very impressed by his ability to get to the point quickly (which TV moderators love) thanks to his military training.</p>

  <p class="text">The other key factor in Wang Jianlin’s background is that he was the director of the office of the mayor in a district of the city of Dalian, a beautiful coastal city in China with Russian influence. The director of the mayor’s office must be socially adept, as the position requires serving as a liaison between many other departments of the government as well as a wide spectrum of society. A useful skill is to be able to drink, because drinking with friends at business functions relaxes the atmosphere and enhances the prospects for closing deals. Indeed, in China, liquor serves as a lubricant in business. Sitting at a banquet table, a person seeking a business or personal relationship should propose a drink to the hoped-­for friend. This practice is called “respect liquor” (Jing Jiu), and it is impolite for the receiving party to refuse. If both sides eventually get drunk, the relationship is sealed or at least enhanced. Being able to propose “respect liquor” and still remain physically functional is an impor­tant skill in the business <span aria-label="126" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126" role="doc-pagebreak"/>environment. Wang Jianlin’s time in the mayor’s office undoubtedly trained him not only to hold his liquor but also to cultivate strong business relationships and serve as a bridge across sectors.</p>

  <p class="text">The second generation of entrepreneurs built a bridge between two backgrounds and environments: government and the emerging business world. A key to their business success was possessing the skills required to deal with the government, often aided by the discipline acquired through their military or government backgrounds. In addition, this generation was also defined by their technological or entrepreneurial sense. They represent a transitional group—­in the future, we will not see many of their kind because the second generation emerged at a stage when the Chinese economy was half-­market, half-­government. Considering that the Chinese government was gradually loosening control of the economy during the height of the second generation, they fit perfectly into this transitional stage.</p>

  <p class="text">The third generation of entrepreneurs emerged in the late 1990s, consisting mainly of young people who were educated abroad or acutely knowledgeable about the West. That was the honeymoon period between China and the West. Many of these entrepreneurs were educated in America. One example is Charles Zhang, the founder of Sohu.com, who started as a bright Tsinghua University student majoring in physics, one of the most popular majors at that time. During his undergraduate days, Charles was already displaying qualities that made him stand out from his classmates. For example, he would go swimming in the icy open-­air swimming pool during the winter to enhance his ability to resist cold and to demonstrate his strength and fortitude.</p>

  <p class="text">After graduation, Mr. Zhang was admitted to the PhD program in physics at MIT. The most sought-­after goal among Chinese graduates in the 1980s was to go to the United States and pursue a PhD, and at that time, MIT was regarded in China as the American Tsinghua. (However, a foreign guest making this reference today would surely offend the president of Tsinghua, who is <span aria-label="127" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127" role="doc-pagebreak"/>seeking to make Tsinghua the Harvard-­plus-­MIT of China.) Once in America, Charles quickly realized that academics may not offer the same influence or fame as the business sector. Thus, when he returned to China, Charles followed the example of Yahoo.com and established his own portal website called Sohu.com, which is now a top portal in China. His US experience and education clearly proved beneficial in his business ventures.</p>

  <p class="text">I was not at all surprised to witness Charles’s success, as we were both at Tsinghua and Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the same time, and he has always been effortlessly cool. During weekend parties at MIT, Charles displayed the best dance moves among the Chinese students. He also once appeared on a dating show on Chinese Central TV, demonstrating his roller-­skating skills, among other talents. After his resounding success with Sohu.com, Charles decided to shun business and social events for a few years, instead studying philosophy and religion. After a few years as a recluse, he returned to the public scene, teaching quantum physics on the internet, staying young and staying cool—­a goal of many entrepreneurs. In the spirit of staying young and staying cool, in many respects Charles Zhang is not too different from Steve Jobs. However, in Chinese culture, such unusually talented people often have a much harder time becoming truly influential since they are often regarded with suspicion.</p>

  <p class="text">Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.com, also belongs to the third generation of entrepreneurs but appears to be Charles Zhang’s opposite. Ma’s path to success proved to be very rocky. In fact, it took him three attempts to pass the college entrance examination, and his embarrassingly low score in mathematics is still widely discussed today. Ma may not realize that this difficulty was partially influenced by his family background, as his parents are professional opera performers, and arts and math are not easily integrated into Chinese education. If Jack were in the United States, he would have been admitted by an elite college on his unique talents, without considering mathematics, and would have <span aria-label="128" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128" role="doc-pagebreak"/>started his business career in college. But in China, he faced the formidable obstacle of the college entrance exam, which serves as the gatekeeper for all opportunities in higher education. Furthermore, forgoing college was not an option, as a young person in 1980s China who did not attend college would have been laughed out of any professional environment. After his third attempt at the exam, Ma was eventually able to attend a small college in China, which at that time was approximately equivalent to a community college in the United States, but now is very famous, partly because of Jack Ma.</p>

  <p class="text">All the while, Ma kept an eye on ideas and trends from abroad. He worked hard to develop his English language skills, taking opportunities to speak with foreign tourists in his hometown, and was among the few Chinese business figures to recognize the importance of the internet early on. Ma initially wanted to replace the Chinese Yellow Book with his portal but later realized that there was a great need to establish a network linking Chinese producers with US wholesalers. He ultimately realized that he could establish an online superstore in which individual retailers could operate. Thus, Alibaba was born, which in China set up a website, Taobao.com. Alibaba serves as a platform for individual businesses in which capital is provided and risks are assumed by individual store owners rather than by the host company, which only charges fees for listing on the website. This endeavor has made Jack Ma into one of the richest and most influential business leaders in China. I come across him quite frequently, mostly when giving talks to an audience. I readily confess that it is a nightmare to speak either before or after him. He is the most argumentative, hilarious, and incendiary speaker I have ever known of.</p>

  <p class="text">In all of these entrepreneurs’ experiences, learning from the West, and from the United States in particular, proved to be a key element in their success. Of course, they were often able to innovate and go beyond the business models they observed abroad, building something new and uniquely suitable for the Chinese <span aria-label="129" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129" role="doc-pagebreak"/>market.<span class="Comment-Reference _idGenCharOverride-4"> </span>For example, the business of bicycles for rent originated in Chinese cities because the business model requires high population density and ubiquitous coverage of cell phone signals.</p>

  <p class="section-break"><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Chinese entrepreneurs have had </span>to fight social prejudice more than the American tycoons of the early 1900s. The reason is that Confucian values place businessmen among society’s lowest classes. In many ancient civilizations around the world, merchants and businesspeople were not held in high esteem within the social hierarchy. In fact, most were subjected to severe discrimination, as in Shakespeare’s <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. This attitude was particularly prevalent in China, where Confucianism designated the king and his relatives as the highest class, followed by government officials, scholars, and peasants. Artisans and merchants were ranked the lowest. Even today, this tradition remains deeply embedded in peoples’ psyches. This could explain why many private entrepreneurs, after becoming successful, seek to establish close relationships with academics.</p>

  <p class="text">When Mr. Wang Shi, one of the most successful real estate developers in China, was in his sixties, he spent two years at Harvard University attending classes, getting acquainted with professors, and simply enjoying spending time around academics. He took great pride in this experience and still loves to participate in university events. In this regard, Mr. Wang Shi is not alone. When I was engaging in fund-­raising for the Schwarzman Scholars program at Tsinghua University, I encountered an extremely generous potential donor. Money was not an issue as long as he could be granted the title of professor. This request was rejected by Tsinghua, an elite university that values its academic reputation. However, not all universities in China are so principled, and some may grant such a request.</p>

  <p class="text">For Chinese entrepreneurs, an even more difficult problem than overcoming social prejudice is discerning how to work with <span aria-label="130" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the government and navigate politics in general. Since the founding of modern China, the government has had control over many key decisions in the business world, as previously discussed. In the chapter about local government, I explained that local government officials are like the CEOs of the holding company of the region. Therefore, private entrepreneurs must interact closely with local government as well as other government agencies.</p>

  <p class="text">The<span class="CALLOUT"> </span>Wanda group provides a good illustration of how impor­tant it is to work with the government. For example, when you travel through most capital cities of Chinese provinces, you will likely find similarly designed structures composed of shopping malls, office buildings, hotels, and high-­end residential compounds. These complexes are all called Wanda Plaza or Wanda Center, developed by the above-­mentioned Dalian Wanda Group. The Wanda Center typically sits in the new center of a city (in China, many cities have built new city centers) and a good distance from the old city. Like the UN building in New York, the centers resemble a matchbox with several buildings thirty to forty stories high. They are usually light brown in color, in a modern style, and anchored by a five-­star hotel—­sometimes a Sofitel, sometimes a Marriott. They usually include an upscale store like Saks Fifth Avenue, an office building, a complex of high-­end condos, and a cinema (after all, Wanda owns AMC theaters).</p>

  <p class="text">The key to Wanda’s success has been its ability to negotiate with local governments better than many other entrepreneurs. Take the example of the city of Baotou, known as China’s capital of rare earth metals. Rare earth metals are a type of refined material that can be blended into steel to create powerful magnets, which are an extremely impor­tant component of most high-­tech products. By 2013, the city of Baotou realized that it needed to have a diversified economy rather than relying mostly upon rare earth elements. Wanda offered to help the city diversify. The company built a business complex in Baotou to help attract non-­rare-­earth firms. This was possible because a Wanda complex is known to <span aria-label="131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131" role="doc-pagebreak"/>raise the stature of any city. Wanda promised that within eighteen months, with Wanda’s experience and expertise, it could build a huge complex comparable to two blocks of Manhattan office space and hotels. The city government, eager to promote local GDP growth, granted Wanda a piece of land at the center of the city. Of course, this land was already occupied, so the government compensated the existing occupants and found other places for them to live, and then turned the land over to Wanda. Wanda delivered on its promise, and the Wanda Plaza is now a landmark in Baotou.</p>

  <p class="text">In contrast to this process, when real estate entrepreneurs like Donald Trump want to develop a piece of land, they must deal with the local zoning board. However, an even more imposing obstacle may come from negotiating with existing landowners. Developing a two-­block business complex within eighteen months would never be possible in the United States. This example reinforces the point that in order for Wanda to succeed, it is imperative for it to work closely with the government.</p>

  <p class="text">Such a business model would not work outside China. While attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, I occasionally come across Wang Jianlin. Frustrated by the small, crowded hotels in Switzerland, he considered building his own hotel, with the main purpose of providing him and other participants a good hotel to stay at when attending the WEF. Unfortunately for Wanda, the process did not move as smoothly in Davos as it does in China, as the Davos local government does not have the same amount of authority to coordinate with local residents.</p>

  <p class="text">A much less fortunate example than Wanda is that of Dai Guofang. Mr. Dai, an outstanding entrepreneur, began his career as a poor mason. By 2004 he had earned a place on the list of the four hundred richest Chinese entrepreneurs. Mr. Dai sought to realize his dream of becoming the Chinese version of Andrew Carnegie by building a huge iron and steel complex in the coastal province of Jiangsu. However, with his masonry background, he <span aria-label="132" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132" role="doc-pagebreak"/>did not understand how harsh the government’s macroeconomic policies could be. This lack of knowledge and attention proved to be disastrous.</p>

  <p class="text">In the middle of 2003, Mr. Dai embarked on his dream of building one of the world’s largest single steel mills, which quickly ended in disaster and sent him to prison. Mr. Dai’s dream project ran directly against the central government ban on new iron and steel, since China was facing the problem of overproduction. The Chinese central government worried that if investments in steel plants were to continue, steel supply in the marketplace would far outpace demand. Meanwhile, antidumping lawsuits had been filed against Chinese exporters in the United States and Europe. Under these conditions, there would be a domestic decline in the price of steel, and many loans rendered to these enterprises would default, creating a serious economic problem. Usually, when the central government issues a policy, some people act contrary to its edicts because they believe that the government is incapable of controlling the trend. In response, the central government apprehends a few high-­profile offenders to exert its authority and emphasize that it is still in control. Before the Chinese New Year on January 22, 2004, the central government sent eight groups of investigators to various locations to halt investments in steel, aluminum, and cement. By April, they arrived in Changzhou, and Mr. Dai’s enterprise fell victim. The investigators shut down the project on the spot, and major investors, including Mr. Dai, were placed under house arrest. After a brief trial, Mr. Dai was imprisoned for counterfeiting sales bills and evading taxes.</p>

  <p class="text">On becoming successful, private entrepreneurs everywhere in the world tend to develop strong opinions and oftentimes desire to participate in politics. The United States has plenty of examples: Andrew Carnegie, Ross Perot, Mitt Romney, and Donald Trump. In China, there is also no dearth of private entrepreneurs who wish to express their opinions through participation in politics.</p>

  <p class="text">That entrepreneurs often have a strong urge to join politics <span aria-label="133" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is well understood by the Chinese Communist Party, which has established special institutions to accommodate this. Moreover, as mentioned previously, Party Secretary Jiang Zemin reformed the party’s charter to encourage entrepreneurs to join the party. In addition, each level of the party committee has a Department of United Front Work serving as a liaison between the party and influential individuals outside the party, including private business owners. Private entrepreneurs also have their own organization, the All-­China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). The leadership of this federation is selected through close coordination between private entrepreneurs and the Communist Party. There are also provincial and city-­level ACFICs. At each level (central, provincial, and municipal), top leaders in the federation are recommended by the Chinese Communist Party to become delegates to the National People’s Congress or members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)—­China’s national legislature and political advisory body, respectively. In addition, several times a year, leaders of the Communist Party at each level hold consultation meetings with leaders of the ACFIC. At such meetings, the private entrepreneurs are not as confrontational or direct in their speeches as, for instance, members of the British Parliament.</p>

  <p class="text">Nowadays, most successful private entrepreneurs in China hold some kind of political position. A leadership position in the ACFIC is one channel, while another is a senior position in one of the nine political parties approved by the Communist Party. As explained above, such positions are usually an impor­tant means to create close ties with the government. At the same time, any entrepreneur who has succeeded in business is actively sought out by the Communist Party to become active in these formal channels.</p>

  <p class="text">In all countries, entrepreneurs trying to enter the political realm must follow certain rules, and interfering in politics by violating these rules is not welcome. China is not an exception. In <span aria-label="134" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the United States, when Donald Trump became president, he had to step aside from managing his businesses. Before that, when making donations to his favorite politicians, he had to follow relevant laws.</p>

  <p class="text">In China, the government encourages private entrepreneurs to join politics through the established institutions, but they are very much prohibited from interfering in politics. The most severely punished behavior is interference in the appointment or promotion of a government official.</p>

  <p class="text">Mr. Huang Guangyu, founder of Guomei, China’s largest home appliance seller, similar to Best Buy in the United States, ended up in prison for seven years as a result of allegedly having tried to help a senior official of the city of Beijing to get a promotion in exchange for business favors. Mr. Huang grew up in a small fishing village in the coastal province of Fujian, and he did not seem to have any interest or ambition in politics. Rather, he just wanted to grow his business as quickly as possible. In his home electronics business, Huang needed land for warehouses and logistics infrastructure. Even though land was essentially given to him free of charge because his business could generate revenue for the city, relocating the incumbent residents is always costly. Mr. Huang was alleged to have gotten help from a senior official in the city of Beijing so that he could aggressively evict people from the land. In exchange, Mr. Huang was believed to have helped the senior official bribe other officials for promotion.</p>

  <p class="text">As we’ve seen in the previous examples, the relationship between entrepreneurs and politics in China can be tricky to navigate. Of all the private entrepreneurs in China, Wang Jianlin might have the most valuable insight into this relationship. In 2014, Wang came to Tsinghua University and delivered a remarkable speech, saying that to do business in China, get close to the government, but stay away from politics. What a perceptive point!</p>

  <p class="section-break-top"><span class="chapter-open-line"><span aria-label="135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" role="doc-pagebreak"/></span><span class="chapter-open-line _idGenCharOverride-2">Beginning in late 2020, </span>the Chinese government started a campaign to control monopolies of internet platforms and the disorderly expansion of capital. Internet platform companies such as Alibaba (retail), Baidu (search engine), JD.com (retail), and Tencent (social network and games) were fined for behavior such as forbidding suppliers from working with other platforms and for not properly reporting merger and acquisition deals in the past. Moreover, internet platform companies were placed under government restrictions when expanding into banking and media businesses. This campaign was costly for the internet platform companies—­by mid-­2022, on average, the market value of each of these companies decreased by around 50 percent. As a result, China’s unicorn companies (highly valued start-­up companies destined for listing on the stock market) greatly shrank in number and value, since the platform companies are usually major investors in the unicorns. Before the campaign, China easily had twenty of the world’s top one hundred unicorns. After the campaign, the number shrunk to less than five.</p>

  <p class="text">What is the fundamental goal of the campaign to control monopolies and the disorderly expansion of capital? It is not simply economics. Many believe that the government is worried that the extensive and expanding influence of the internet platform companies will erode the government’s control of social and political affairs.</p>

  <p class="text">Many believe the government is wary about the big tech platform, and they cite the case of Jack Ma and Alibaba to support their views. The huge influence of Alibaba has made Jack Ma an iconic hero among the young Chinese. Each year, Jack would organize a huge rally in a stadium, in which he would come out wearing a cool outfit or sporting a tai chi move much like Michael Jackson in his live music and dance shows. He would give bombastic speeches stating, for example, that if the inefficient banking <span aria-label="136" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136" role="doc-pagebreak"/>industry refused to change, his internet company would change it. In a stunning speech given in November 2020, he announced that his financial platform Ant Finance would do exactly that, having lined up almost all the impor­tant investors to support him. His speech came one week before the IPO of Ant Finance. The government immediately suspended the IPO. It is unclear whether Jack Ma’s passionate speech caused the government to cancel the IPO, or whether he was already aware of the decision and took the opportunity to vent his anger through his speech. Either way, this example shows Jack’s audacity in China. In fact, four years before that, in late 2016, Jack flew to New York City and had meetings and took photos with president-­elect Trump, promising to create two million new jobs for the United States through Alibaba, a move beyond any plan or imagination of any top government official!</p>

  <p class="text">It seems that China and the United States are remarkably similar in worrying that internet platforms and their founders, like Jack Ma and Mark Zuckerberg, have too much influence in politics and society. While many men and women in the US Congress and politicians are currently deliberating about how to best set up new regulations and laws to resolve the issue, China’s approach has been to first rein in the influence of big names in tech, and then, once they are in the domain of the government, to settle on new policies via rounds of debate. The Chinese approach is much more precautionary than the US one, for better or for worse.</p>

  <p class="text">Does this mean the end of the dynamism in Chinese internet industries, and more broadly, the whole community of private entrepreneurs? Many inside and outside China seem to hold this view. I disagree. Since the policy wave of reining in the internet platforms, I have been arguing that the internet and private entrepreneurship are essential for a healthy and dynamic Chinese economy, without which the Chinese government will not be able to accomplish its grand goal of national revival. Currently, the Chinese government is playing it safe. After carefully watching <span aria-label="137" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the US and European experiences when it comes to regulating internet platforms, the Chinese government will likely issue specific regulations and loosen up its currently tight control on these companies. Indeed, by early 2023, the Chinese central government began to issue policies to encourage internet companies to grow faster.</p>
